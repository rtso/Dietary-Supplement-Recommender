Two minor down sides: 1) during my first and second trimesters, this did make my pee smell funny. Not awful, just different. 2) The dosage is 4 pills daily. 4 giant pills.

I asked her if she took the prenatals her Dr. Prescribed (we are in the same network) she said yes... I told her to stop and switch to my vitamins, she did... Guess what?!? You guessed it...

It's estimated that half the population may have the MTHFR gene mutation and can't process folic acid. So it's super important to make sure you take a good vitamin with folate (and methyl folate if you do have it). Folic acid otherwise just pools in the body since we have a hard to converting it like the real thing and it ends up becoming toxic. Also, can cause miscarriages and issues with brain development if taking the synthetic Folic acid due to lack of folate being absorbed and passed on to baby. Make sure you find a physician who is familiar with MTHFR.

Things Garden of Life had that the store bought did not: protein, vitamin K, B1, Pantothenic Acid, Iodine, Magnesium, Selenium, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Molybdenum and Folate (store bought had Folic Acid, which is different). Other reviewers also complained about the price - to which I say, this is nourishment for your growing fetus, you get one chance at this, I will happily pay a little extra to ensure my baby is getting the best quality vitamins and minerals, it's only for a few months (and each bottle should be about a two month supply)."}, {"title": "Wish it had more B VITAMINS for my daily value", "rating": "4", "helpful": 5, "body": "I love these whole food derived prenatal vitamins.. because i try to steer as far away as possible from synthetic ones.

I was told to take a multivitamin and tried several, but often it made my stomach uneasy and I would give up on the pills after a few days.  On the suggestion of a friend, I started looking towards prenatal vitamins.  He said they would be good for me because they often have ingredients used to calm the stomach, and unlike some other vitamins, they are not oversaturated and give you just what you need.  I did some research on laboratory tests of which vitamins are the most potent and best quality for your money.  This product came up in that search, and despite the steep price, I decided to give it a try.  I like that you take three pills a day to get your total vitamin intake.  I think this helps keep my stomach from reacting to too many vitamins at once.  After three weeks I noticed that I had more energy (one of the vitamins that was getting depleted was vitamin B) and that my nails were a lot stronger than before.  I also had no stomach issues with this product, which partly because of how natural it is compared to other vitamins on the market.

I have to supplement with a whole food, low dosage iron supplement, my OB suggests 27gr of iron in a prenatal, these only have 18, and initially I decided that since it was 100% of my intake, I'd give it a shot and try to supplement through my diet, however around week 12 my iron level came back normal, but borderline low. 3 week after I started noticing my hair was a little frazzled and I had a few strange bruises, which greatly concerned me. All that being said, I would never switch prenatal, I'd much rather add the very affordable iron supplement, and use this prenatal as my basis. I plan to continue using these till the birth of our little guy and beyond."}, {"title": "Superb ingredients", "rating": "5", "helpful": 1, "body": "I love these prenatals!

I had an issue at 6 weeks pregnant and the doctors said my son would more than likely be born premature.  At my gender ultrasound they discovered that the cord to the placenta was placed at the end instead of the middle where is should have been.  Because of this the doctors said my baby would be small.  Well I am happy to say my little guy was one week late and weighed 9 pounds 11 ounces.  He is healthy and happy.  I will say that I still experienced fatigue while pregnant, but it was nothing out of the norm.  So I will not say that these vitamins boosted my energy but they kept me from being tired.  I did not have one ounce of morning sickness.  I did not crave unhealthy food and I craved water which I have a hard time drinking a lot of on a daily basis.

My only problem is that I recently went to get my annual PAP and spoke to my gynecologist about starting to try for a baby.  She asked me whether I was taking prenatals, I told her yes and the type and she told me to make sure that it didn't have over 50% Vitamin A (I guess a lot of RAW vitamins do) as this has been known to cause birth defects.  She says that the prenatals are perfect for before becoming pregnant but once pregnant I should use a vitamin that is 50% or less Vitamin A.  My issue is, you become pregnant and don't even know it immediately.  I certainly wouldn't want to be taking these on a daily basis at a period of time that is super important for the growth of my baby.  I looked this up online to double check and sure enough there are studies showing increased Vitamin A consumption has caused cleft lip/palate,eye defects (tested on animals).

I couldn't wait it out any longer to see if it would go away because it was affecting me being able to work/function.  I really wanted to like this product.  I will say this as a positive: I have a lot of stomach issues, and these vitamins didn't upset my stomach at all.  I mainly just had problems with headaches.

It's a lot to remember, but your and your baby's health is worth a little more effort. After I had the baby I wanted to save costs and started on Rainbow Lite while I was nursing- bad idea. If your vitamins give you bright yellow pee, that means it's synthetic and you aren't absorbing the nutrients. Rainbow Lite gave me bright yellow pee, and I was tired all the time.

They made me feel like i was burping up mint on occasion.For a more natural option, I don't feel like the price on these is terrrible, especially if you do subscribe and save. They are cheaper and have a lot more in them compared to some of the ones I looked at, at Wholefoods.

I think its because when you take a multi vitamin, certain vitamins block the others from working.  For example, iron doesnt get absorbed when you take it with calcium.  I finished this bottle and just take a b complex wih breakfast (which has folate and other important vitamins), iron with vitamin c on an empty stomach in the afternoon, and vitamin d, omega 3, and magnesium at night.

I am due in two months with our second baby.  I have to say these have been great vitamins.  With the first pregnancy, I used prescription prenatals because I didn't think about there being another option.  Even though these are more expensive, I think they are definitely worth the investment.  After all, your time and energy are just as important if not more than spending less on prenatals.  I have had acne most of my life, and I have noticed my skin has been clearer than it has ever been.  Part of that may be hormones, and part of it is diet and the probiotics in these vitamins.  Sometimes I miss a pill a day, but I still notice a big difference from first pregnancy.  To get the most from these vitamins, I would suggest eating right as well.  Lots of water (filtered if possible); and limit soft drinks, sugar, caffiene, and anything containing high fructose corn syrup.  hfcs is harder on your liver than sugar (which thus saps more of your energy).  And of course we all know to eat plenty of vegetables, protein, and fruit, etc.  A hamburger from McDonald's does not count as good protein- but if it is the only option at the time, don't beat yourself up over it... just make it a rarity.  All in all, I definitely recommend these vitamins.  I used another whole food vitamin in the beginning of my pregnancy which were good but tough on my gag reflex.  These are very easy to take.  I do wish they had more magnesium in them, most of us don't get enough of that nowadays.  It would be nice if they were a little cheaper especially if you're in a financial crunch, but if you can eliminate other unnecessaries (like above mentioned items :)), $1 a day for good vitamins can be workable."}, {"title": "three a day was a hard dose to keep up ...", "rating": "3", "helpful": 0, "body": "three a day was a hard dose to keep up with, and I had a hard time swallowing them sometimes."}, {"title": "GREAT for mommy", "rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "body": "Great digestible and metabolizable vitamins for mommy or mommy to be!

All in all, I would have stuck with another vitamin except it had way too much vitamin A (which is oil soluble and can build up over time which is not good for developing babies per my doc).  I also was not super pleased with the amount of Calcium in the vitamins.  I can't do dairy and therefore need more calcium - these had less than my regular multi vitamin that is not prenatal.  And also there wasn't enough B-vitamins for me.  Sure, I can take these and add those as extra supplements, but when these vitamins are already so expensive, I just feel like it's not the best deal and vitamin for me.  So, there you have it, they are so much better than the ones I find at the drugstore (I don't even think those should be labeled prenatal - i mean 50% of your DV of some stuff?

I didn't initially think the reaction was to the vitamins but after some careful thinking I pinned it back to these.  My face was swollen and bright red with bumps all over. Ears were extremely swollen so much that it was causing a hearing issue temporarily. I had these raised white bumps all over that itched.  I was nervous my throat was gonna close because of the face swelling so I went to the ER. A good portion of my body is covered in scabs from scratching.

I am due in two months with our second baby.  I have to say these have been great vitamins.  With the first pregnancy, I used prescription prenatals because I didn't think about there being another option.  Even though these are more expensive, I think they are definitely worth the investment.  After all, your time and energy are just as important if not more than spending less on prenatals.  I have had acne most of my life, and I have noticed my skin has been clearer than it has ever been.  Part of that may be hormones, and part of it is diet and the probiotics in these vitamins.  Sometimes I miss a pill a day, but I still notice a big difference from first pregnancy.  To get the most from these vitamins, I would suggest eating right as well.  Lots of water (filtered if possible); and limit soft drinks, sugar, caffiene, and anything containing high fructose corn syrup.  hfcs is harder on your liver than sugar (which thus saps more of your energy).  And of course we all know to eat plenty of vegetables, protein, and fruit, etc.  A hamburger from McDonald's does not count as good protein- but if it is the only option at the time, don't beat yourself up over it... just make it a rarity.  All in all, I definitely recommend these vitamins.  I used another whole food vitamin in the beginning of my pregnancy which were good but tough on my gag reflex.  These are very easy to take.  I do wish they had more magnesium in them, most of us don't get enough of that nowadays.  It would be nice if they were a little cheaper especially if you're in a financial crunch, but if you can eliminate other unnecessaries (like above mentioned items :)), $1 a day for good vitamins can be workable."}, {"title": "best out there!!", "rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "body": "I could take this prenatal on an empty stomach and when i had nausea.

I found that if I took them by themselves, they gave me horrible burps.  I added in a fancy pro-biotic and the herb-y tasting burps subsided. I should note that I'm not pregnant.  The dr told me to take prenatal vitamins if I was trying to conceive so I know it's not because I had morning sickness.  I think compared to others out there on the market they are a good choice for some, but they also gave me terrible gas.  And I will qualify that last statement by saying that I have been taking an iron supplement every day for the last four months so I know it's not just that the iron is upsetting my stomach.  All in all, I would have stuck with another vitamin except it had way too much vitamin A (which is oil soluble and can build up over time which is not good for developing babies per my doc).  I also was not super pleased with the amount of Calcium in the vitamins.  I can't do dairy and therefore need more calcium - these had less than my regular multi vitamin that is not prenatal.  And also there wasn't enough B-vitamins for me.  Sure, I can take these and add those as extra supplements, but when these vitamins are already so expensive, I just feel like it's not the best deal and vitamin for me.  So, there you have it, they are so much better than the ones I find at the drugstore (I don't even think those should be labeled prenatal - i mean 50% of your DV of some stuff?

I did not take many prenatal my first trimester, except I did take Folic Acid.  For some reason every time I took a prenatal (even one that was an RX marketed to ease morning sickness) it made me feel awful.  I felt nauseous, tired, and just plain ill...  I thought it might just be part of my pregnancy, but when I would skip the prenatal I would feel much better...  Now just entering my 2nd trimester I thought I should take a prenatal regularly, so I choose this one.  So far I don't like how I feel, my nausea came back, I feel tired and crappy.  I am not happy I shelled out over $30 for these to feel the same as before.  I am so constipated I can't stand it, and that might be a factor in how awful I am feeling.  But since this vitamin does have more iron that I am used to I know that has upset my system a bit.  I am going to continue taking them, since I know my body needs the nutrients, but I will not be buying them again.  I just wish I could find a vitamin that would make me feel good.

I'd recommend them to anyone who needs a prenatal and has had problems with swallowing other prenatals because of the bad smell/taste/etc. I also like these because they have folate instead of folic acid which I have heard that folic acid isn't as good and may even be linked to some disorders in children.

Before I was pregnant, I had been taking the multivitamin for women.  They worked wonderfully for me.  However, when I became pregnant with my second child I decided to go with another brand of prenatal vitamins.  Part of it was because of the cost and the fact that I didn\u2019t want to take three pills a day.  That was a big mistake.  My daughter, who is 15 months old, still will not sleep through the night.  Her father and I are constantly up at night with her.  We also have a 10 year old who is in sports.  There are many nights we have home and away games.  It was getting to the point to where all I wanted to do was sleep and not get up.  My energy level was down drastically.  It wasn\u2019t because of my iron, we\u2019ve had that tested and it was fine.  In fact, there were some days when I took my prenatal and iron pill I still wouldn\u2019t have any energy.  That didn\u2019t sit well with me. So last week I decided enough was enough.  I bit the bullet and ordered New Chapter\u2019s prenatal.  I got these because I plan on weaning her from nursing very, very soon and it seemed pointless to get the postnatal.  Let me tell you, from the first day I started taking these, I had much more energy.  I was still tired, but not overly exhausted like I had been.  The next day I was able to clean the house, still tired but not like before.  It has now been almost a week and this is the best I have felt in two years.  I wish I had stuck with this brand from the beginning.  It\u2019s possible my pregnancy could have been more enjoyable.  But I\u2019ll know if we decide to have another one.

That definitely works for some people who would rather not take the horse pills that other PNVs are, so taking 3 small pills may be a blessing. And some may say, all 3 can be taken at one time if you'd rather not have to remember to take 3 pills at separate times (which would be my issue) - but in that case, if you can manage to swallow 3 at a time, why not just take the 1 big pill. Further more, 3 pills (1 serving) of these have 600 mcg folate, whereas others do have more folate in just 1 pill ... The minimum requirement for women pregnant or intending to become pregnant is 400 mcg, and most vitamins actually have 600 mcg.. but for those that think more is better, other supplements have 800 mcg in one pill.

To test this you can take a \"cheap\" vitamin and a \"good\" vitamin (like New Chapter) and lay it on a cookie sheet and put it in the oven.

I take the entire dose in the morning (have read some people take the multiple pills throughout the day), and it's been fine for me.  Digests easily, no gastric issues, and easy to swallow.  I don't like that the daily dose is three tablets, but since it's treating me well, I'll trust that there's a reason they only cram so much goodness into each little pill. ;-)  Also, I take an Omega supplement that contains the recommended amount of DHA.  So, if you take this prenatal, make sure to get a DHA supplement that works for you.  I recommend this brand or Nordic Naturals.

These pills also don't have as strong of a smell, which is really nice. Among other things, they have 600 mcg of folate and 1000 IU of Vitamin D3. I did just notice one ingredient is organic brown rice - which is disconcerting after the recent news about brown rice syrup and arsenic... something to investigate which is why the four starts instead of five."}, {"title": "Best prenatals out there!", "rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "body": "After having a bad bout of post partum depression after my 3rd son's birth I switched to New Chapter Organics prenatal vitamins with my last 2 pregnancies.

Although I didn't really run this by any doctor polls and I'm certainly not a medical professional, but based on my research it seems as if pregnant women need 1000 mg of calcium per day?... This only has 75 mg, which seems insufficient, although I guess if you're guzzling milk and other dairy products then maybe this doesn't matter.  I actually went and bought a second bottle of calcium supplements for this very reason.  Also, some warn against too much vitamin A, and at 5000 IU these vitamins seem to be a little much?  Again, I'm not medical professional and this is my first pregnancy but the numbers don't seem to add up.

I generally try to keep a healthy diet but not obsessed.

I went on amazon did a search for prenatal and this one showed up as the most highly rated, it's obviously a little more expensive than the ones you pick up at the local grocery but I said screw it. I started off with the smaller bottle to see if I liked it, i did, and bought the bigger bottle next. Like I said I didn't do extensive research into every vitamin included in this but here are some points I like: you can take it at any time in the day, 3 pills per day which you can take all together or spread them out, no nausea, do not need to take with food, and in general i feel good when i take them, want to take them!

First off, my mistake - I misread the label when I bought these, and thought these were meant to be 1 pill per day, not 3 per day to get the full serving size. That definitely works for some people who would rather not take the horse pills that other PNVs are, so taking 3 small pills may be a blessing. And some may say, all 3 can be taken at one time if you'd rather not have to remember to take 3 pills at separate times (which would be my issue) - but in that case, if you can manage to swallow 3 at a time, why not just take the 1 big pill. Further more, 3 pills (1 serving) of these have 600 mcg folate, whereas others do have more folate in just 1 pill ... The minimum requirement for women pregnant or intending to become pregnant is 400 mcg, and most vitamins actually have 600 mcg.. but for those that think more is better, other supplements have 800 mcg in one pill.

Now, i don't think these pills are \"mini\" by any means, and you're supposed to take 3 of them per day (all at once or throughout the day, your choice).  They are about the same size as a normal Centrum vitamin, maybe just a little thinner.  But i can take all 3 at once and it doesn't bother me.  They taste... well... vitamin-y, but hey - they're vitamins.  And that aftertaste seems to go away quick enough.  Also, and maybe it's just me, but they help keep you regular.

Nature made has best quality fish oil overall and their DHA doesn't contain any extra vitamin e (at least not these newer bottles) which is a huge plus as too much vita,in e is harmful to your baby. Also, it's the only smart prenatal to put less than 15IUs of vitamin e in the prenatal itself as again most of these Prenatals, even prescription ones, make the grave mistake of putting 30IUs of vitamin e when more than 15ius has proven to cause heart defects and other issues to the unborn fetus. As far as all the complaints about red and yellow colorists etc, these new bottles don't contain any as they responded to complaints and removed them. Giving 4 not 5 stars as while it meets the requirements and wisely takes caution to not go over the recommended limits with each vitamin, it does miss out other, while less crucial, still beneficial vitamins and minerals including copper, iodine and selenium. Rainbow Lite has better ingredients and from whole food sources as well as being a 1 a day pill but not any DHA so in the end opted for this. Also, their product has too much vitamin e and so erring on the side of caution, I had to go with these.

As far as all the complaints about red and yellow colorists etc, these new bottles don't contain any as they responded to complaints and removed them. Giving 4 not 5 stars as while it meets the requirements and wisely takes caution to not go over the recommended limits with each vitamin, it does miss out other, while less crucial, still beneficial vitamins and minerals including copper, iodine and selenium. Rainbow Lite has better ingredients and from whole food sources as well as being a 1 a day pill but not any DHA so in the end opted for this. Also, their product has too much vitamin e and so erring on the side of caution, I had to go with these. Overall, the best option."}, {"title": "After we did the deed I was pretty confident that that was the winning night", "rating": "5", "helpful": 5, "body": "First off, I am a real customer and I was NOT asked to review this product. With that being said, I believe that out of all of the methods and products I have tried to get pregnant, THIS MAY BE WHAT GOT ME PREGNANT!!! For about a year I have tried just about all of the fertile lubricants, fertility supplements and ovulation prediction kits. My biggest problem was being extremely fry all of the time. Even during ovulation I was more moist than normal but my cf would dry quickly and I would resort to lube... LOTS of lube. I ordered these prenatals in June but I didn't start taking them daily until October, 2016. By November I noticed that I had become more moist than usual, particularly during ovulation. In December I was so wet during ovulation that I didn't even need to use an ovulation test. I could tell that I was definitely fertile and ready to conceive! We didn't need ANY lube!! After we did the deed I was pretty confident that that was the winning night. I took a pregnancy test a few days BEFORE my missed period and I already had two very dark lines, I was indeed pregnant! HERE'S THE SECOND BEST PART: I am now 10 weeks and haven't had any morning sickness! I read that taking prenatals with DHA while ttc lowers your odds of having morning sickness. I will add that along with taking the NatureMade Multi+DHA, I was also taking 81mg chewable aspirin and B-complex vitamins everyday. I was drinking about 5-6 glasses of water daily (though you should drink about 8 glasses daily)."}, {"title": "Just pay the extra couple bucks and buy from brick and mortar instead of online", "rating": "1", "helpful": 9, "body": "I have used these vitamins for years to help with hair and nails, when I became pregnant, and now while nursing.

I opened the sealed container to find the normal brown capsules with black around the seams, looking like mold.  Some of the capsules were also dull instead of the normal shiny, and some were misshapen.  Let me reiterate that I have used these for years and have never seen the product look like this.  The capsules in the new bottle I purchased from my local grocery store looks like they always have.  I checked, and the bottle was not expired...I think these were not stored or shipped properly.

This is my second pregnancy, with my daughter I had to switch to a few different ones then be put on prescription prenatals. I tried eating before taking them, taking them at night, taking them before eating and had different results with different ones. One main issue for me was nausea from taking them. So naturally I was kind of scared to see what kind of reactions I would have with these and how many I would have to try to find ones that agreed with me. After doing some research I found these highly recommended as they had DHA in them which is something that is really important for me and my child. As an added bonus only one is to be taken once a day (my other ones I had to take 2). I am so happy that I did my research and found these, they haven't caused any side effects and are super easy to take. Since they are gel caps I do keep mine in the fridge as I live in Texas where it's always humid and after reading another persons review saying that theirs got all soft and gooey. It also helps me in remembering to take it, as being pregnant you seem to always find yourself in the fridge for either something to eat or something to drink lol. I highly recommend anyone try these first before others. They are a great price for the amount you get, at my local store they want more money but you get less than half the amount.

If you are trying to conceive and are maybe having difficulty like me (we've been trying for over a year now) my Dr. said you can help your pregnancy (in addition to taking a prenatal vitamin) by taking DHA daily (gel or capsule form), also Vitamin D (5,000 units/day), and Folate (800mg/day) *Methylfolate is apparently easier to absorb. To help with egg quality it is recommended to take CO-Q10 (200mg 3x/day), and DHEA (25mg 3x/day). My gf who successfully underwent IVF recommended an awesome book called \"It Starts With The Egg\" by Rebecca Fett.

Everyone that is around my 10-month old is amazed for one reason or another. It started early... The day he was born he tracked everyone and everything. The day after he was born, the pediatrician looked amazed when he pushed up for a laying position and was able to lift his head and motioned as if he was trying to crawl. He was able to track the phlebotomist across the room at his 2 week appointment, all while holding his head up. Now, at 10 months if he can't climb or reach something, he pushes things closer so he can stand up on them. I never taught him to do that, but that seems a bit advanced to me. He does wear 24-month clothes, so he is a bit bigger than normal. I know genetics and nutrition has a lot to do with it, but I swear these pills had to have helped my little guy.

I had no deficiencies while taking these, but I had many when taking a traditional prenatal vitamin in pill form (one that contained calcium and iron).
