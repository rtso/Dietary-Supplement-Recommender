He suffered a June 2013 heart attack which severely reduced the ejection fraction of his heart to 15-20 while in the hospital. Diet and exercise helped to raise the EF to 25-30 for many months after that as reflected in echo-cardiograms taken twice over time. He was told by both his cardiologist and a surgeon who installs in body defibrillators that he had pretty much peaked with regard to EF improvement due to the passage of time. Well having started on Naturewise Ubiquinol in January 2015, the echo test done in August indicated a spike of the EF up to 35-40. His diet and exercise regimen did not really change during the time he started on this product from what he was doing post heart attack up to the start of taking Ubiquinol.

I soon found out he was wrong, however my research took me to several Ubiquinol brands, before I discovered Natururewise.

I reached 200mg/day and still was not getting rid of the pain. I purchased a water alkalizing machine and started drinking 9.5 alkaline water and I cut my statin down to 1/2 tablet (20mg) daily, as blood work improved. Then, since pain still persisted, I told my Dr I wanted to experiment with 1/2 tablet statin every other day (a year ago) and I chose to try Naturewise Ubiquinol. My next blood work was very good, but I could then report to my Dr that the severe (wake me up at night) shoulder pain was no longer occurring.

Powerlifting demands professional training and extremely strict diet control. Supplements of all kinds are available to increase muscle, energy levels, and overall excellent health. Supplement choices are numerous and not without issue when one is result oriented. I started using Naturewise Ubiquinol several weeks ago. I would not ordinarily review a product (if at all) after a few weeks since most supplements take months if not years to experience positive results. I can assure you that I have the energy level of a 70 year old man, nothing to brag about. I experienced after a week of use a higher level and a more sustained level of energy during weight training. I train about 10 hours a week. I use neither caffeinated pre-workout supplements nor pre-workout supplements of any kind. I do take vitamin, mineral, and protein supplements throughout the day. The only change I made in the last year is the daily use of Ubiquinol. I am contemplating using additional Naturewise products in my routine.

It was not like energy like say what caffeine gives you, but after I had taken it for about a week I noticed I would get more done in the day without feeling exhausted.  As I have gotten older I have noticed a real drop in my energy level and I think it may be partly from a drop in my CoQ10 or Ubiquinol.  These vitamins have helped bring that back.

I am 48 years old so I prefer to take Ubiquinol rather than the Ubiquinone version of CoQ10 because I believe it is better absorbed by people over the age of 25. Here is a brief summary of the benefits of Ubiquinol, as listed by Dr. Mercola: helps you to produce more energy for your cells; boosts your heart health; acts as an antioxidant to help protect you from free radicals; helps you reduce the signs of normal aging; helps you maintain blood pressure levels within the normal range; provides a boost to your immune system; supports your nervous system. I feel great! Other supplements I currently take include: 1 a day multivitamin (no Iron), additional vitamin D3, probiotics, enzymes, magnesium, iodine, astaxanthin, mushrooms to boost immunity and curcumin.

I bounced around  a bit trying to find a good supplement finally found one that changed my energy levels quite significantly but since I need about 600 mg a day the product was over 240.00 a month. So I went to Jarrow believing that since it was the ubiquinol form I should do just fine. It took me a year to put two and two together because of all the other diseases (disorder} that come with a mitochondrial disorder, but I finally did. It took one month after the switch from my old company that was mentioned in Mayo Clinic trial paperwork for me to start to detoriate. As soon as I figured it out I called my old company they were kind enough to offer a discount because of a diagnosed disorder and overnighted my CoQ10 it took 3 weeks to start to feel somewhat better I am know at week 4 and am working my way back to walking daily. I used to walk 4 miles a day. Imperative to keeping all of my multitude of symptoms at bay. I haven't been able to walk more than 1/2 mile in over 10 months. At this point I am back to 1 1/2 to 2 miles a day. My message to you is you get what you pay for. My diseases are progressive and I have to take several vitamins and most of there's did not show up in my blood work so I was deficient in those as well at times. I am a severe case.

After numerous heart tests, blood tests, sonograms and one visit to the emergency room, the heart doc said it might be inner ear goings on.  Two days ago I researched ubiquinol online.  All my symptoms were there, plus the facts that this med is for mostly healthy people and not for long term use.  For me it was a dangerous drug. The doctors I saw asked about any new supplements, but none of them seemed to know about ubiquinol.  I felt better 24 hours after the last pill; no more nausea or fainting.
