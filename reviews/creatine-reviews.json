Believe me, I have tried almost all of them:) German crea-pure creatine is superior in every way. Don't believe the hype of other \"cutting edge\" products. Just remember that this stuff dissolves much more effectively and quickly in WARM beverages such as coffee or tea. The more dissolved the crystals are when they reach your GI tract, the better the absorption and the quicker as well. You want to get as many unmodified molecules of this stuff into the muscle cells as possible. Great price on Amazon.

Ya, you don't have to stop or cycle it but I like to take a break from it to see if it really gave me results or if it was just in my head. Since I have been off of it I feel like a have to try a lot harder in my workouts now. When I was on it the extra reps and weight were just \"there\"...like it was a deep reserve or energy.

When my friend who plays football in college encouraged me to email the coaches of his team and ask if it would be possible to play for them, I did. I got a response saying they would love to have me out for a visit, and on that visit I was offered to play for the team next fall.

I graduated last year (class of 2012) from high school where I played football for all four years and started varsity for three of them. After high school, this year, I decided to go to a community college to save money and transfer to a four year school later on, officially ending my football career, or so I thought. When my friend who plays football in college encouraged me to email the coaches of his team and ask if it would be possible to play for them, I did. I got a response saying they would love to have me out for a visit, and on that visit I was offered to play for the team next fall. I hadn't been a hardcore lifter since football ended in high school so my muscle density was way lacking in the strong department. But after hearing about this product and its good reviews I was like what the heck and gave it a shot. After a month of use my bench has already gone up 15+ pounds and all my other lifting groups have seen significant increases. My recovery time is shortened and I barely feel an ache after a workout. I would highly recommend this product to a serious lifter getting after it at least 4 times a week. It works very well and has a great taste to it. I use it also as a pre workout. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking to build good solid strength and do it very fast.

In 1 weeks time I have gained SERIOUS power and strength while working out! I get more reps and have more energy with each set. I've changed NOTHING in my daily life/workout other then add Decacor to my supplement list and it's already showing. Even at a high price this product is still worth every penny. I use 1 scoop in my (new, non creatine added) protein shake and drink it immediately after my workout. On my few off days I take it with a morning protein shake soon after I wake up. I did NOT 'pre load' my system with this in the begining like the package says. I didn't feel the need since my pre workout drink has 5g of creatine monohydrate in it and the post work out protein shake I used to take until recently had 2.5g. My body has already had a steady influx of  creatine in it. Keep this in mind though, DECACOR has 10 different creatines in it so you may feel the need to do the 'pre load' like the container says. I did NOT and I am still reaping the benefits of this product! I also have been working out 5-7 days a week for just over a year now, and pre work out and post work out drinks have been a staple in my routine since day one.", "helpful": 6, "rating": "5"}, {"title": "Decacore", "body": "This product definitely deliverd.

I haven't tried any other flavors besides Fruit Punch, but I've heard a lot of good things about the grape flavor. Also concerning my body weight. I did have a little bit of bloating even when taking just one scoop after my workouts, but after one container of this. I was able to gain 6-8 pounds. I noticed a huge difference in my arm size.
