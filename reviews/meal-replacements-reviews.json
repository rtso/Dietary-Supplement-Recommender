I bought both the vanilla and the chocolate and they are so bland. The pea protein taste is the dominant flavor in both, with a super sweet aftertaste. I can't understand all of the people bashing the reviewers who say it's too sweet... People perceive the sweetness level of erythritol and stevia differently and for me, there is too much in these drinks and not enough chocolate or vanilla flavor. I also wish that the flavor wasn't \"natural flavoring\" and instead was a defined organic extract. Whenever I see the words \"natural flavoring\" I think of the dreaded beaver anal gland extract used in food. Be that as it may, these are too expensive to toss and the taste won't improve with age so I have one of these everyday after my workout. My only advice is to add the bare minimum of 7-8 oz of liquid so you can get it down quicker.

Orgain has a lawsuit in regards to this on account of the evaporated sugar cane juice controversy. I have no issues with the sugar content, but it was helpful to know that it could potentially create spikes. OVERALL: Will see how Cost-effective this product turns out to be. No heartburn.

I LOVE Shakeology but the price of it is ridiculous.  If I had the money, I would be buying it but we just don't have room in the budget for and I'm never going to be a coach in order to sign people up to get a discount.  So I scoured the internet for something comparable and this is what I zeroed in on. I was nervous about buying a whole canister because some reviews of Garden of Life Raw Organic Meal left me thinking that I was going to have to plug my nose to get it down. So I went to my local health food store and bought single packets of every kind to see which of them I liked the best.  They are all great but chocolate is my favorite.  I don't know, maybe the formula has changed since those first reviews were written because I absolutely LOVE this shake. My whole body feels happy when I start to drink it, just like it did with Shakeology.  Maybe it knows that when I start to drink this stuff all the incredible nutrients are coming it's way.  I may just be a weirdo who has a taste for intolerable things, but I got my canister today and made a double serving and my three, almost four, year old wanted a taste.  He insisted on having more and about drank half my shake before demanding his own.  He is a super picky eater that I can rarely get to eat anything, so this was big.  I blended the powder with 8 oz of almond milk per scoop, 1/3 frozen banana, 1 TBS PB2 and some ice. Perfect.  So satisfying.  Fills my need for sweet at only 9g carbs per serving (when you add in the 1g carb from the unsweetened almond milk). Tonight I wanted a snack before bed (I'm pregnant...leave me alone) and just used a shaker bottle with 8 oz almond milk, 1 TBS PB2, and some ice cubes and it was wonderful. My cravings for junk food and candy disappear when I drink this. I am so happy that I found this amazing stuff. I hope it stays around for the rest of my life.

If you play around with additional ingredients and ratios, this stuff can taste pretty damn good for what it is. You have to understand that it is a RAW blend of a s***load of different fruits, vegetables, enzymes, grains, and legumes. So the taste is actually pretty phenomenal considering the stuff contains everything from apples, broccoli, onion, and garlic to lentils and adzuki beans. It's best enjoyed with flavors that really compliment the vanilla. I recommend going with CHOCOLATE. I tried it the second time by adding some chocolate vegan Shakeology, a little extra vanilla extract, and some almond butter and I was shocked at how much better it tasted. (Also, my liquid base is always 50/50 water and unsweetened vanilla almond milk.)  So yeah. Overall I'm very satisfied with this.

I'm glad it arrived when it did because I had not eaten lunch yet and was in the mist of cleaning and doing my hair. So I decided to go head and have it as a snack until I was ready to eat. Anyway when I open the container I was a little disappointed that it was not full. If you look at the pic I took this is the amount that was in there when I opened it. This is why I'm giving it four stars. The taste wasn't bad, but I only had vanilla almond milk at the time to try it with. I would not recommend using this it makes it have a very sweet weird taste, plus you want to stay away from added sugar anyway. But I was not ready to try it with water yet. But I will try it again with the original unsweetened almond milk which I really think it will taste great. Overall so far I like it and have tried a lot of other shakes but this one is at the top, solely because its ingredients are all natural. The taste isnt the best but you can't expect it to be that tasteful without sugar. Also I used my smaller blender bottle to mix it, and it mixes very easily. I also read reviews about it getting very thick after a few mins so I drunk it fast.  **UPDATE**  It's been about two weeks or almost two weeks since I brought this. And  I'm glad I did, I have actually gotten use to the taste (in fact I actually crave this stuff now) and its really good. The taste reminds me of a thick chocolate milk shake. It was never as bad as most people made it seem, so I guess I prepared myself for the worst which i think made it not taste so bad. I'm trying to eat bigger meals during the day and smaller meals at night. So I usually am drinking this for dinner. It says to use 8oz of water or almond milk/ rice milk and one scoop of the raw meal for a snack. And 16oz of liquid and two scoops of raw meal for a meal but I usually use my 12oz blender bottle just because I drink it faster this way. So I use 12oz of liquid (almond milk plain) and 11/2 scoops of raw meal. This last all night for me and I give myself a 12hr period of no eating and I'm still satisfied until its time for breakfast the next morning. I havent tried putting in any extra yet, cause i havent had the time to. So im glad it still taste great without having to add extras saves me alot of time, i just shake, gulp it down and go. I really believe this is one of the best meal replacements on the market today, I have tried many and never like the taste or didnt feel completely satisfied from them. And the best part is your getting so much nutrition from it. Please buy and try it your self. I'm excited to try the vanilla spiced chia next.

I'm glad it arrived when it did because I had not eaten lunch yet and was in the mist of cleaning and doing my hair. So I decided to go head and have it as a snack until I was ready to eat. Anyway when I open the container I was a little disappointed that it was not full. If you look at the pic I took this is the amount that was in there when I opened it. This is why I'm giving it four stars. The taste wasn't bad, but I only had vanilla almond milk at the time to try it with. I would not recommend using this it makes it have a very sweet weird taste, plus you want to stay away from added sugar anyway. But I was not ready to try it with water yet. But I will try it again with the original unsweetened almond milk which I really think it will taste great. Overall so far I like it and have tried a lot of other shakes but this one is at the top, solely because its ingredients are all natural. The taste isnt the best but you can't expect it to be that tasteful without sugar. Also I used my smaller blender bottle to mix it, and it mixes very easily. I also read reviews about it getting very thick after a few mins so I drunk it fast.  **UPDATE**  It's been about two weeks or almost two weeks since I brought this. And  I'm glad I did, I have actually gotten use to the taste (in fact I actually crave this stuff now) and its really good. The taste reminds me of a thick chocolate milk shake. It was never as bad as most people made it seem, so I guess I prepared myself for the worst which i think made it not taste so bad. I'm trying to eat bigger meals during the day and smaller meals at night. So I usually am drinking this for dinner. It says to use 8oz of water or almond milk/ rice milk and one scoop of the raw meal for a snack. And 16oz of liquid and two scoops of raw meal for a meal but I usually use my 12oz blender bottle just because I drink it faster this way. So I use 12oz of liquid (almond milk plain) and 11/2 scoops of raw meal. This last all night for me and I give myself a 12hr period of no eating and I'm still satisfied until its time for breakfast the next morning. I havent tried putting in any extra yet, cause i havent had the time to. So im glad it still taste great without having to add extras saves me alot of time, i just shake, gulp it down and go. I really believe this is one of the best meal replacements on the market today, I have tried many and never like the taste or didnt feel completely satisfied from them. And the best part is your getting so much nutrition from it. Please buy and try it your self. I'm excited to try the vanilla spiced chia next.

When I got this, I tried it in a strawberry and kale smoothie and it tasted pretty awful. Not unbearably awful.

If you play around with additional ingredients and ratios, this stuff can taste pretty damn good for what it is. You have to understand that it is a RAW blend of a s***load of different fruits, vegetables, enzymes, grains, and legumes. So the taste is actually pretty phenomenal considering the stuff contains everything from apples, broccoli, onion, and garlic to lentils and adzuki beans. It's best enjoyed with flavors that really compliment the vanilla. I recommend going with CHOCOLATE. I tried it the second time by adding some chocolate vegan Shakeology, a little extra vanilla extract, and some almond butter and I was shocked at how much better it tasted. (Also, my liquid base is always 50/50 water and unsweetened vanilla almond milk.)  So yeah. Overall I'm very satisfied with this. As a vegan, it's tough to find good meal shakes that pack a lot of protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, AND probiotics without being loaded with sugars and this is pretty awesome stuff in that it touches all of those bases."}, {"helpful": 2, "rating": "1", "title": "New formula: \"Original\" is NOT \"Unflavored\"!", "body": "I have been a happy user of this product for many years.

Garden of Life Raw Meal used to be unique in that it offered a plant-based meal replacement with all the benefits of other powders but without any artificial sweeteners.  This was the reason I bought this product in the first place, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Personally, I added honey for a bit of sweetness, and I appreciated that I could get this sort of product without any kind of sweetener pre-added.  I ordered the larger tub from Amazon recently and was shocked when I read the ingredient list and saw that Stevia was added, and I will be returning it.  Like many people, the entire reason I chose this particular brand was because it DID NOT have any kind of artificial sweeteners, and I was left to my own choice to add sweetener.  Stevia might be \"natural\" but studies have shown that it has the same effect on the human body that artificial sweeteners do, and therefore is not a healthy option.  I don't understand why \"unflavored\" means they would add vanilla flavor and artificial sweetener.

So, I experimented with only using 1-1 1/2 scoops and found the right consistency. I mix mine with almond milk or coconut almond milk and it is really good. After the first few shakes, you kind of get used to the texture.  I then bought the unflavored protein powder to mix with fruit smoothies. You get your protein, but not the gritty texture.

I know what \"gritty\" is, as the product was described by another review, but this was NOT simply the texture of a sandy suspension.

It's the best way to start the day. Full of vitamins and essential minerals your body needs to run at optimal performance. The taste is good with just water but with almond milk its just like a really good smoothie. Easily digestible and does not leave any lingering unpleasant after taste or upset stomach. After using this for a week I was amazed at how I felt. Eating a big breakfast slows you down and makes you feel tired and bloated, this fills you up longer and boost your energy with no caffeine or sugar crashes. This will replace your regular daily multivitamins routine along with your daily meals. I recommend using it in the morning then eating a late lunch or early dinner then taking this again a few hours before bedtime. This will help you sleep better and boost your over all energy levels for the next day and save you money along the way. You can't go wrong with this. Our bodies require a 50/50 diet consisting of half RAW and half cooked meals and this is a great way to start getting your fruits and veggies. It's also good for a post workout recovery protein shake. 5 stars I wish I could have started using this year's ago."}, {"helpful": 2, "rating": "5", "title": "Full of win but don't make it the way the package directs", "body": "After reading a lot of the reviews, I expected this to be awful but I was surprised.

I will also say that I headed the advice of many before me. I could not imagine what this would be like if I prepared it exactly as directed. I make two big drinks out of one scoop. I pour 8 oz. of unsweetened vanilla almond milk and 8 oz of water in the blender with 1 scoop of vanilla raw meal. I don't like frozen slush so I don't use ice but I will say that it is better cold. It's not thick this way which I prefer. It easily held my appetite at bay for 4 hours and when I did sit down to eat, I didn't eat as much.

We like this best mixed with almond milk and I prefer it mixed thin...one scoop to maybe 8- 10 oz of almond milk and maybe even a couple of ounces of water as well.  It gets a little gelatinous otherwise. My husband used to always blend it in the blender with ice, but honestly I am just fine putting it in a cup and stirring it thoroughly with a fork and I notice he is starting to do the same. I'd be fine mixing it with water as well, which is helpful if you are on the go.  If I wanted the full two-scoop long-lasting fill up, I'd, personally, drink two cups of it vs. mixing it thicker.

I prepared myself as best I could mentally; was ready to gag and spit and barf it all back up.  Seriously, this stuff is about as tasteless as you can get.  Sort of a chalky texture, but it wasn't bad at all.  It didn't taste good, but it certainly didn't taste bad.  Didn't taste like much of anything.  Just a strange texture and it's all over.  No trauma.  I don't know what all these whiners are on about.  This much nutrition this easily is a no brainer.  I'll do 2 scoops next.  I'm sure it will be doubly thick and chalky, but I can't see it being a problem to get down.  If it is, I will just go back to mixing 1 scoop at a time and do it twice, maybe at breakfast and lunch.  Don't let the negative taste reviews scare you away from this product.  Maybe they just don't like the texture, but that can be minimized by mixing 1 scoop at a time.  It doesn't taste like grass clippings, and it doesn't taste like dirt.  I mixed it in a plain old plastic shaker, and that's probably a must.

On the first day I got the raw meal powder, I mixed it with just plain ole water. I was surprised to see that it didn't taste awful as other reviews stated. It didn't taste good but it didn't taste bad either, though I can definitely see why it would taste awful to others. I find it hard to drink something that doesn't taste good to me even if it doesn't taste bad either, so after 3 drinks of the raw meal with water I decided to try it out with sweetened almond milk. This was my first time drinking almond milk so I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the taste, especially since I never liked the taste of cow's milk even as a kid. I am glad I made that decision to switch to almond milk because it actually tastes good to me, though I'm pretty sure it has more to do with the almond milk itself rather than the powder. I noticed some reviewers mentioned the thickening of their drinks and, fortunately, I never had that problem. This is probably due to the fact that I add slightly more water/milk than what is recommended and also because I drink it within 10-15 minutes of making it instead of letting it sit for a long time. Overall, I really liked the Garden of Life Vanilla Raw Meal because it filled me up with only one scoop for a few hours(long enough until lunch) and unexpectedly made me feel more energized. Unfortunately, I most likely won't buy it again because I'm trying to change my diet into a much healthier one through whole foods and know that I can't always depend on a meal replacement (partly due to the cost)."}, {"helpful": 2, "rating": "4", "title": "The Powder I Love To Hate", "body": "Well.

Garden of Life seems to set a high standard for quality and I've tried other products and decided on their Raw Organic Meal. I did read they had a Salmonella recall earlier this year, but from what I gathered it was all worked out. After reading a ton of reviews it sounded like the taste was a major concern and most people thought it was horrible tasting. Still, I chose this over other brands I reviewed due to quality of product. I ended up getting vanilla, which seemed to taste okay - not great, but not gross - just okay. Drinking it cold helped and drinking it quickly, since there is a note-so-great after taste. However, overall the flavor was alright. However, it did nothing to curb my appetite and I thought it was supposed to be a meal replacement. I didn't have the bottle with me when I finally thought, okay, what is the deal, so I came back onto Amazon to check it out and noticed the Vanilla Raw Organic Meal was no longer available on Amazon. I contacted Amazon and they looked into it, reporting it was pulled due to health concerns. Of course I was worried due to the earlier outbreak of Salmonella this year, but I hadn't gotten sick. Amazon suggested I get rid of whatever was left and refunded my money. I noticed today it is available again, but I'm cautious to buy it on Amazon. I am a member of a co-op here in Seattle and they have all of the GoL products there, but they cost twice as much as it does on Amazon :( Though I feel safer getting it at the co-op.

My day doesn't feel complete without a half or full dose of this product, it has tons of vitamins and minerals, has a moderate carbohydrate level, but is packed full of non-animal protein and has a great amount of soluble and insoluble fiber. The only possible downside would be the taste, which isn't really that much of a downside considering all the good stuff which comprises this powder. I mix half a serving with a cup of water twice a day, it tastes green to me (fresh green veggies) and earthy, smells green too but fairly neutral in flavor. It's not too sweet or salty. The mixture slightly thickens the longer it sits, so if you would prefer a more liquid consistency then it should be ingested immediately after combining but if you'd like to eat it with a spoon then let it sit for a few minutes after making. It'll thicken up. I've tried mixing this powder with different fruits (bananas, strawberries, peaches, etc.,,) and yogurts to see what kind of flavors it would produce. It tastes much sweeter and really good at first but the aftertaste can be a bit disconcerting and produced a slight nauseous feeling. Drinking with water works best for me and you definitely get the sense that you're doing something good for your body each time you finish drinking it. My skin looks great, I feel energized and it doesn't weigh me down or produce any stomach upsets. It's a great product.

I like that they are organic, gmo-free and that they have folate in this product and others as well. You honestly can't say that for most meal replacements. Folic Acid is what you will find. Anyway, I started taking Raw Meal and Vitamin Code Raw prenatals. The prenatals helped my morning sickness when I took one pill three times a day as opposed to 3 at a time. Also, again, folate not folic acid is what's in the prenatals. I started taking the chocolate flavor of Raw Meal because of two reasons: 1. a life long family friend was on death's door (literally) and made a comeback and lived. Only thing that was changed was that they started taking Raw Meal. 2. I wanted to make sure that I was getting the extra nutrients I needed for the baby. I did the research and found that if a meal replacer was plant based you could take it while pregnant. So, if you ever have been pregnant you know how baby can stop you up, and, thankfully, Raw Meal took care of that with over 50% of my daily fiber needs in the recommended serving. Also, I was worried I wasn't getting enough iron or protein, but, again, a huge chunk of that was taken care of by Raw Meal. So, here is the part where I mention what you need to know. If you use water as your mixing base, use cold water. It is drinkable, but it just tastes better cold. Another thing is I use raw, unfiltered honey to sweeten it. I know many of the people that buy this product are vegans, so that's a no no. I guess if you are vegan you could use stevia extract. I just haven't tried it that way to give an opinion about it. Also, I WOULDN'T mix this in a blender. Maybe I'm just the odd person that thought that using a blender would work since I didn't have a shake cup at the time, but I'm telling you that the shake cup is much better to use. The last piece of advice I can think of is this, DRINK IT, DON'T LET IT SIT! You can just use more water to thin it out if it gets this way, but just be aware that it will get THICK if you let it sit too long. Again, it is fine to drink it thinned down, just tastes better when it's first made. Something you may want to take into consideration before buying this product are your tastebuds. If you are a person who is constantly eating/drinking sweet things, you will probably think this doesn't taste anything like chocolate. My allergies get really bad when I consume a lot of sugar. By a lot, I mean I usually get a soar throat, runny nose, and occasionally sore ears from less than a whole can of pop. In other words I don't consume a lot of sugar, so my tastebuds have adapted accordingly and this shake tastes pretty good to me. I can drink it without the honey honestly, but it just gives it that extra little sweetness that makes it taste that much better. My end thoughts would be that I would totally recommend this product to anyone, but it would be good to do the research and make sure it's right for you because of the possibility of it not tasting good to that person and since it is a bit pricy. Amazon usually has the best price from what I have seen.

It is gritty, earthy, and has an overriding artificial sweetener flavor over the chocolate. I don't like sweet drinks so this is still a real downside. I mix it with very cold water and that truly improves it. Also this thickens the longer you let it sit. If you don't keep shaking it, it can get lumpy and the texture becomes difficult to drink.

It can get thick right away, so if you have shake texture issues, like I sometimes do, just don't mix the full serving all at once, do it half a scoop at a time with lots of water or almond milk (yum), drink immediately, then repeat.  I also highly recommend whisking food shakes as the shaker cups always leave lumps that make it unpalatable.  Nice idea, but using a whisk and wide mouth glass is better.

Something about a warm, mushy vanilla meal supplement is not as appealing. I have a high tolerance for health drinks so maybe some people hate it full stop. For me, it's not a beverage that can be consumed quickly, which gives me a lot of time to contemplate the meaning of life and the problem with meal supplements. I really think there's a trade off here. You can't load that much fiber, flax, chia, organic platypus poop (or whatever the new thing is this week) into a drink and have it taste like an amazing vanilla milkshake. If it does taste like an amazing vanilla milkshake it is probably loaded with sugar or you're just hallucinating from the enormous dose of fiber- the likes of which your colon has never seen. Another aspect I don't hate about the Raw Meal Vanilla drink is that it leaves you very full. Now, the only other Raw Meal drink I have on stock at home is the Raw Fiber, and that is far more like a science project gone awry than the Raw Meal.

Not sure if its the live probiotics or whatever but I feel slightly sick after having one of these. My friend who recommended this also had the same problem. But she still swears by it. It is filling for several hours, and I have been replacing one meal a day with this and lost 7lbs in less than a few weeks. So for my purposes, it works.

I've found that blending it with a banana or two really sweetens the taste and more importantly gives it a milk shake consistency/thickness which makes it much more pleasantly edible.

I have a variety of mix-ins for flavor, nutrients and variety. I typically use cocoa powder and stevia to sweeten it, along with organic vanilla extract. I also put in a handful of fresh kale, which I can't even taste due to the cocoa powder. Sometimes I add a dash of peppermint oil, or cinnamon, or a packet of Starbuck's Via instant coffee, so it doesn't get boring. Since it's a vanilla base, I sometimes skip the cocoa and use a banana and some frozen berries for a fruit smoothie. Be creative and add whatever flavors you like, just always use a milk base and a blender. It takes a couple minutes to prepare and I drink it while I get ready in the morning.

After using Garden of Life Perfect Food Raw Organic Green Super Food for nearly two years, as the staple add in to my smoothies, I tried this. It's higher in protein and blah, blah, blah. Here's what happened. The product triggered intense sugar/food cravings (that never happened with Garden of Life Perfect Food Raw Organic Green Super Food, whether chocolate flavor or plain). I was like a hose beast sugar addict trolling for carbs and it was unpleasant to have to deal with that. Also, perhaps related to that, this product which has ridiculously ginormous scoops, two make a serving, DID NOT make me feel full. I would have a shaker cup smoothie, having drank the excess from the blender/Vitamix, and would still be HUNGRY. Obviously, every product isn't right for every person. I don't care about the texture. Is this product rather thickening? Uh, yes... but then so is cancer and type two diabetes so only children complain about the texture of foods. I did find that adding unsweeteened dark cocoa + peppermint oil thinned the smoothies considerably (and gave them a mint-chocolate fresh delicious taste). Still, because it's clear that, because something in this is a) addictive for me and b) I can't actually metabolize and use as fuel (leaving me HUNGRY), this product is no good to me. That said, maybe try a sample at a health food store (or a sample pack if they have those), as different foods are right for different people.

To make it drinkable: more powder, more liquid. Using only water or diluting soymilk/almond milk with water is best, it's watered down and drinkable. If you only use milk then it will be very thick.

I blended it all very well (using the cream setting on my blender). Then chilled it in the fridge. The banana helps smooth it out and adds sweetness while chilling it blunts some of the natural bitterness of the powder.

It didn't taste good but it didn't taste bad either, though I can definitely see why it would taste awful to others. I find it hard to drink something that doesn't taste good to me even if it doesn't taste bad either, so after 3 drinks of the raw meal with water I decided to try it out with sweetened almond milk. This was my first time drinking almond milk so I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the taste, especially since I never liked the taste of cow's milk even as a kid. I am glad I made that decision to switch to almond milk because it actually tastes good to me, though I'm pretty sure it has more to do with the almond milk itself rather than the powder. I noticed some reviewers mentioned the thickening of their drinks and, fortunately, I never had that problem. This is probably due to the fact that I add slightly more water/milk than what is recommended and also because I drink it within 10-15 minutes of making it instead of letting it sit for a long time. Overall, I really liked the Garden of Life Vanilla Raw Meal because it filled me up with only one scoop for a few hours(long enough until lunch) and unexpectedly made me feel more energized.

I'm a small person but a pretty big eater and the one scoop is enough to fill me up. Anyway, the directions say you can mix it with low sugar juice. By all that is good and holy, if you read my review take my advice and DO THIS. I mix mine with orange juice and drink it just about every morning (Sunday being the exception to the rule, I always skip drinking it on Sunday for various reasons). On my second day of drinking RawMeal I not only used orange juice, but I also used A STRAW. That makes drinking it so much more palatable.

For me, it's not a beverage that can be consumed quickly, which gives me a lot of time to contemplate the meaning of life and the problem with meal supplements. I really think there's a trade off here. You can't load that much fiber, flax, chia, organic platypus poop (or whatever the new thing is this week) into a drink and have it taste like an amazing vanilla milkshake. If it does taste like an amazing vanilla milkshake it is probably loaded with sugar or you're just hallucinating from the enormous dose of fiber- the likes of which your colon has never seen.

Since going gluten free by choice my daughter was diagnosed Celiac her freshman year at college.  I am now a confirmed Celiac via DNA testing. So now it isn't a choice it is a permanent way of life.  I had digestive issues all my childhood and finally found the answer but the years of damage to my intestines have taken about three years to heal and now for the first time in my life I have a weight problem.  A 20 lb. weight problem.  Its not that I am eating a ton of food.  I am very strict on my intake.  Carbs from processed foods or pasta aren't my problem but I do have a sweet tooth.

This stuff taste like green-brown. It tastes like someone took a bag of lettuce that had been sitting in the fridge long enough to get brown and blended it with something you might find on the floor of a forest bike path. Not pleasant. I tried adding peppermint oil to it to try to mask the flavor, but, no, that didn't work at all. I eventually ditched the entire concept of trying to mask the flavor and drank it while keeping my nose closed to completely shut off any flavor.

I believe this is a much better alternative to; herbalife, slimfast, body by vi and all of the soy and whey protein shakes on the market!  Not to mention it is affordable. I would say this product is for someone who is interested in a healthier diet  and not just focused on loosing weight."}, {"helpful": 0, "rating": "5", "title": "Really good for meal replacement or supplement.", "body": "Our family loves Garden of life Raw Meal mixes. The chocolate is my favorite. Yes it can be a little chalky but that is easily overcome by adding extra liquid and drinking it as soon as you make it.

Due to the high fiber content(8 grams per scoop!) it does fill you up and keep you going for a while."}, {"helpful": 6, "rating": "4", "title": "Surprisingly good taste for something so healthy!", "body": "I was reluctant because of some reviews about the taste, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised it is not bad at all.  It doesn't taste like sugary chocolate milk, but really very similar to the powder version of slim fast.  I did not want something with any fake sugar substitutes or any soy for health reasons.  I also wanted something that had a lot of health benefits, high protein, high fiber, high in vitamins/nutrients, but again no fake sugar or soy, so this was almost impossible to find!!!!  This is literally the only one I could find that had all I was looking for, so I did give it a try.  With plain water, the taste is just alright, I can drink it, but I don't love it that way.  So, I prefer it with 1% milk, and then instead of using 2 full scoops (for calorie reasons) I am using one scoop blended with 1 cup milk, a few ice cubes and sometimes half a banana to sweeten, and it comes out great!!  Ice cold, with the ice, it does not seem to thicken like some of the other reviews indicate--but with just plain water it does seem to.  I'm working on a big cup of a smoothie of this I made about 2 hours ago actually, and it has not thickened at all.  If I'm doing well on calories that day, I will treat myself to a tablespoon or peanut butter or honey or both, and it is really yummy that way!  Another thing I love about this shake is that it DOES keep me full for at least 3 hours).  I can have a shake for breakfast and I don't feel hungry again until lunch time, I can have another shake and I'm really good until dinner (keep in mind I'm having HALF the serving size each time--only one scoop instead of two, with milk and only half a banana--so in total for both meals I get one serving of this, 2 glasses of milk and one banana), then I have a light dinner and one snack later in the day.  Although this is not a \"weight loss shake\" it works well for that purpose as long as you keep the calories down--either by cutting the dose in half, or using just plain water with it--I prefer half a dose with milk rather than just water.  Anyway, I'm thrilled.  I gave 4 stars because I'm waiting to see the overall  health benefits and with plain water the taste isn't as good as I would like, but overall I am thrilled with this product.  I've been using it for a month now.  Don't worry about digestive issues, some people mentioned, at least for me it is not a problem.  If you are not used to fiber at all, you might have a problem if you use the full dose, so maybe start smaller for a few days, but if you already have fiber in  your diet normally, this will not affect you.  I do find that it is a good idea to drink extra water with this type of fiber to keep things regular.  I'd love to see them come out with a weight loss version of this product with lower calorie content per serving and perhaps something a little sweeter, but this is a staple for me until then!"}, {"helpful": 0, "rating": "5", "title": "For people who don't like the taste.", "body": "I am about halfway through my first canister.

Unlike almost everyone else that wrote a review, I do not use it to replace an entire meal.  Instead I use it to replace snacks between a meal.  Since I do not eat big meals I get hungry every 3 hrs.  For example, I can have a light breakfast at 6:30 before I leave to work, maybe a small bowl of oatmeal or one hard boil egg and a cup of tea, but then at 9:30 I will take my morning break at work and I will prepare a smoothy.  For those of you wondering how I manage that at work: I pre-blend all the ingredients at home but I don't mix the Raw Meal into the smoothy until I am ready to drink it. I have an automatic mixing cup which I purchases at GNC and its been very helpful to mix the powder into my smoothy at work.  As for the serving size, if you wish to make it a snack, I use 1/2 scoop for a 12-16 ounce smoothy.

I have to agree with most of the other reviewers here though: the taste leaves much to be desired. It's very... \"earthy\" and kinda gritty. Fortunately I have an iron stomach, so I can choke it down pretty quickly and go about my day. Your mileage may vary. At first I mixed it with chocolate soy milk, hoping that the chocolate would mask the flavor. The result was \"meh\". Too thick, and not so great. Then I tried mixing with apple juice as another reviewer recommended, and it's not too bad. The sweetness of the juice cuts the flavor long enough to chug it down, and that seems to work for me.

I used a shaker and filled the shaker with about 3/4 water and went to town. The powder broke down well and didn't clump but it has a very thick grainy consistency. The flavor to me was similar to the stringy part of a banana with a faint hint of chocolate. It didn't taste bad but the consistency took a little getting use to. I think my stomach was a little confused and it went down so so but that's somewhat normal in my experience when trying new protein powders etc.. I think I will try only 1 scoop next time and see how it goes.

I purchased the plain variety, no vanilla flavoring. The first day I mixed it with water and gulped down the thickish drink. It was nasty but I was not going to waste my money! The second day I re-read the label and realized, holy smokes, I was only drinking half the recommended serving. (One scoop vs. 2). How people manage to drink the full serving I do not know. I'm a small person but a pretty big eater and the one scoop is enough to fill me up. Anyway, the directions say you can mix it with low sugar juice. By all that is good and holy, if you read my review take my advice and DO THIS. I mix mine with orange juice and drink it just about every morning (Sunday being the exception to the rule, I always skip drinking it on Sunday for various reasons). On my second day of drinking RawMeal I not only used orange juice, but I also used A STRAW. That makes drinking it so much more palatable. Invest in some stainless steel smoothie straws (I got mine here on amazon), they work better than plastic straws (yes, I speak from experience!). I've been drinking it for about 2 months now.

However, I've been unable to complete a full serving of this drink after 5 attempts of varying combinations and proportions. If it was just a bland or disgusting flavor I think I would be able to deal with that better because I could mix it with larger ratios of fruit or drink water afterwards to rid my mouth of the taste, but that's not the case. The problem with this product is the texture. It has a viscosity reminiscent of a lugee or that Nickelodeon toy Gak, even when heavily diluted with liquid.

This makes sense given that its low in sugar, which is one of the reasons other products of this type are so mixable, but Id rather blend it a lil more and cut out all that sugar.

You should write a book; I would definitely buy it.  I had the same problem regarding acquiring the taste, with raw meal and I am a vegetarian (I eat only fish and other vegetarian products; no eggs or dairy).  Anyway, I bought this raw meal chocolate flavor almost a year ago and just finished it this morning.  When I first tasted it, I decided to discard it.  It WAS  (I use past tense) the worse tasting thing that ever gone to my mouth.  But I thought about the money I spent and just left it in my cupboard.  I then bought some shakes including Vega products and Plant fusion which I like.  However, recently I became too busy and stopped working out so I gained a few pounds.  I decided to replace 2 meals a day (short term) until I get back on track.  I needed something heavier than the other shakes because I get hungry too quickly when I use them, so I return to my raw meal that has been sitting in my cupboard for all these months.  I am feeling much better since I started drinking it and I stay full longer; I mixed it with unsweetened almond milk and I used only one scoop because it is way too think.  I used between 10 to 12 ounces of the almond milk to 1 scoop.  I like to let it sit for a while because it taste like hay if drink immediately.  I used extra milk so it's stays in liquid form when I am ready for it.  After it\u2019s soaked it's not bad; it has like a whole grain porridge texture to it, hence, making it more palatable.

The only reason I gave it four stars is because I saw from some reviews that the trick to making it drinkable was cinnamon. I swear I thought someone suggested a tbs so that's what I used along with 20oz water and the powder. I mixed it with a fork and it turned a dirt brown but it never became like sludge or whatever. There was no clumps and it mixed fairly well. I was pleased about that. Tasting it was a different story. I made my mom try it first to see if it was good and she said it was but would have been better if there wasn't so much cinnamon. Finally, I decided to try it and I agreed. It was like a sweet plant juice that I mistakenly overpowered with too much cinnamon. It was still better than what I thought it would be but next time I'll make sure to not put as much cinnamon.

You should write a book; I would definitely buy it.  I had the same problem regarding acquiring the taste, with raw meal and I am a vegetarian (I eat only fish and other vegetarian products; no eggs or dairy).  Anyway, I bought this raw meal chocolate flavor almost a year ago and just finished it this morning.  When I first tasted it, I decided to discard it.  It WAS  (I use past tense) the worse tasting thing that ever gone to my mouth.  But I thought about the money I spent and just left it in my cupboard.  I then bought some shakes including Vega products and Plant fusion which I like.  However, recently I became too busy and stopped working out so I gained a few pounds.  I decided to replace 2 meals a day (short term) until I get back on track.  I needed something heavier than the other shakes because I get hungry too quickly when I use them, so I return to my raw meal that has been sitting in my cupboard for all these months.  I am feeling much better since I started drinking it and I stay full longer; I mixed it with unsweetened almond milk and I used only one scoop because it is way too think.  I used between 10 to 12 ounces of the almond milk to 1 scoop.  I like to let it sit for a while because it taste like hay if drink immediately.  I used extra milk so it's stays in liquid form when I am ready for it.  After it\u2019s soaked it's not bad; it has like a whole grain porridge texture to it, hence, making it more palatable.  I usually sip it and because it is kind a sweet I drink water in between and I haven't felt this good in a long while.  I stay full and love angles are falling off so quickly; it's unbelievable!

Whoever tried to give this to their children should not have done that. This is a meal replacement not a supplement. It is a little grainy but I quickly learned the colder the water the better. I let my water sit in the freezer and just start forming ice crystals before mixing it. I also add 1/2 tsp of pure honey and a few dashes of cinnamon. Pure/raw honey and cinnamon are very very good for you too! It also helps it taste better! Drink it fairly quick as it will thicken. Yes the sprouts and seeds in it thicken but that's part of how it works to keep you full and it's slow but easily digestable which is very helpful. Just remember this is meant to replace only 1 meal a day. I'm not vegan but I do follow the Paleo diet eating meats minimally and focusing more on raw fruits,veggies, and nuts. I'm not some super nut just a mom with joint health issues trying to get back in shape and feel better again, not to mention set a good example fort daughter.

Of course, I didn't want to drink it in the first place. I got the unflavored kind thinking I would get something that tastes akin to what papier-mache or wallpaper paste look like. Nope. This stuff taste like green-brown. It tastes like someone took a bag of lettuce that had been sitting in the fridge long enough to get brown and blended it with something you might find on the floor of a forest bike path. Not pleasant. I tried adding peppermint oil to it to try to mask the flavor, but, no, that didn't work at all. I eventually ditched the entire concept of trying to mask the flavor and drank it while keeping my nose closed to completely shut off any flavor.

Breakfast was a huge problem. I purchased the chocolate version of this product and it was fantastic! I hesitated at first due to so many bad reviews about taste but I found if you mix it with almond milk or soy milk it was great. Since that time, I have been diagnosed lactose, gluten and soy intolerant. So I mix it with lactose free milk. First, let me say the chocolate flavor is very filling and the vanilla is not. I could go most of the day without feeling hungry after consuming the chocolate and usually did not eat lunch till 2. I drank the shake at 7am.  I purchased the vanilla because the chocolate gave me a headache. The vanilla flavor did not fill me up the same way. It did sustain me till a regular lunch noon. I was bummed. So if your body is as sensitive as mine, what works for me, is 1/4tsp of chocolate and the rest vanilla. BTW- the vanilla is gritty and not very tasty the chocolate takes the edge off. My two cautions are first when I purchased the chocolate flavor it was twice the size as the vanilla for the same price so read the label carefully before purchasing my bad! second, if you buy the product don't let it sit around after mixing or it will turn into sludge on the bottom of your cup."}, {"helpful": 0, "rating": "4", "title": "Natural source for raw protein", "body": "I wanted to get protein in a healthy way.

Whoever tried to give this to their children should not have done that. This is a meal replacement not a supplement. It is a little grainy but I quickly learned the colder the water the better. I let my water sit in the freezer and just start forming ice crystals before mixing it. I also add 1/2 tsp of pure honey and a few dashes of cinnamon. Pure/raw honey and cinnamon are very very good for you too! It also helps it taste better! Drink it fairly quick as it will thicken. Yes the sprouts and seeds in it thicken but that's part of how it works to keep you full and it's slow but easily digestable which is very helpful. Just remember this is meant to replace only 1 meal a day. I'm not vegan but I do follow the Paleo diet eating meats minimally and focusing more on raw fruits,veggies, and nuts. I'm not some super nut just a mom with joint health issues trying to get back in shape and feel better again, not to mention set a good example fort daughter.

I pour 10 ounces of cold, sweetened Blue Diamond Almond Milk in my VitaMix blender, turn the switch on low, then add ONE fully-packed scoop of Raw Meal (vanilla flavor) powder and blend for about 5-8 seconds.

I'm not typically hungry when I get up early in the morning, so the full 2 scoops with 16 oz. of liquid was too much for me. I figure half a serving is better than no breakfast at all.

The first time I tried it I thought I might puke it up because of the consistency and taste and I don't puke easily. I used a blender bottle and mixed it with water. It was difficult to drink it out of the small opening of the bottle because it congealed. It was also a bit grainy which doesn't bother me. I am very tolerant of shakes that don't taste good but I wondered how I would be able to choke down the remainder of the product. I tried it again with milk in a different shaker the next day. I drank it as fast as I could to avoid any congealing and I have to say it wasn't bad. I found myself wanting to have another shake later in the day. This product seems like a very good and healthy product and I am happily surprised to report that I had absolutely NO digestive problems as I tend to get diarrhea easily. I am not sure if I will order chocolate again but I will try another flavor. My advice to other people who have purchased this product and hate it is to mix a very small amount (like a teaspoon or tablespoon) in with their regular protein shake. It will take a long time to get rid of but you will still be benefiting from the health benefits Garden of life Raw Organic Meal. I don't recommend this to people who don't like products that taste like \"diet food\". I have a feeling that the reason why so many people rate this high is because of the health benefits of the product, not the taste. I should also caution that while this is a meal replacement, it may not substitute for a real meal if you are REALLY hungry. If you are really hungry drink this shake and then follow it up with something small within an hour. For me it works better if I drink this later in the day after I have had more substantive food."}, {"helpful": 0, "rating": "5", "title": "Excellent product.

I had diarrhea as water coming out with violent vomiting while I was sitting on their toilet for at least one and a half hours straight. I relaxed in their lobby for another hour so I could drive again since I was pouring sweat and was extremely exhausted.

I use 1/2 fz. banana, 1 cup soy milk, 1 cup water, and a handful of ice cubes. This keeps it from becoming too thick (which I find impossible to swallow). Making it this way is actually tasty and enjoyable. (The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I didn't want anyone to expect it to taste like an ice cream milkshake. I'd have given it 4-1/2 stars, but they don't offer that option.) I have tried this with and without the banana and other fruits. I have found that both this one and the vanilla meal taste best when mixed with the 1/2 raw banana (and I'm not that big of a fan of bananas otherwise). Another good-tasting option is to use 1 cup soy milk and 1 cup brewed, flavored coffee (unsweetened; I like my coffee sweetened with agave and soymilk--don't get me wrong--but when adding it to this powder, you don't need the extra sweetness and calories). I originally bought the vanilla because most reviewers preferred the vanilla over the chocolate and the plain. However, I found single-serving pouches at our local Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers and bought a pouch of each flavor before my Amazon order of Vanilla arrived. I actually preferred the chocolate and was disappointed that I'd ordered the vanilla. However, I have almost used up my (huge) container of vanilla meal powder and have enjoyed it every day and am ready to now get a chocolate container.

If the bad taste had been the only issue I could have gotten around it and wouldn't be writing this review. But in short, it's the worst stuff I've ever tasted outside of drinking pure noni juice. It tastes like you might imagine swamp water with rotten veggies to taste and it smells just as bad. However, I really wanted to make this stuff work because I was impressed with the ingredients, but this company really needs to keep working on the formula. My height is 6'1\" and my weight is 230lbs, there's no way this is a \"meal replacement\" for me and I'm not a big eater. So after learning that it's not a meal replacement, I figured I would just drink it pre/post work out since it does contain 34g of protein per serving. I tried to put the mix into my shaker bottle through a funnel and the powder was so thick it got clogged up in the funnel and wouldn't go down, I had to use a rolled up paper plate to get it into my bottle. That should give you an idea of how thick this stuff is going to be when you try to mix it up with water. Here's the worst part: One serving requires two (2) scoops of the mix! The scoop that comes with this stuff is huge, twice the size of the standard scoop that comes with most whey protein powders i.e. EAS, ON, etc. After you put two level scoops of this powder into a glass containing 16oz of water, as directed by the instructions, you have a mixture with the consistency of mud! It doesn't dissolve well at all in water and it doesn't mix well either, it clumps up! If you let it stand for a few minutes hoping it will have a chance to dissolve better, it all settles at the bottom into one huge lump of nasty goo. The only way I would ever consider drinking this mixture again is if someone paid me at least $10 per glass to drink it. I wouldn't drink another glass of this junk for any less than $10 per glass.

First, let me tell you that I was raised in a taste-stoic family, such that we still joke that we kids would have eaten a raw dog turd if it was put on a plate and called dinner.  \"I don't like it\" was not allowed, or you had to eat more of it.  I was ready for this raw meal stuff to taste bad, thinking other reviewers were perhaps just being pansies. NOT SO!!!  An adequate description of the aggregate esthetic of this would have to go WAY beyond the domain of the word \"bad\" and any of its nearby cousins.  Granted, I did register a crap-tastic taste, but the texture of this nasty concoction hit me first, hardest, and worst.  By way of real-life comparitors, I'm used to the fibrous texture of the good-old-days Metamucil, and though I don't like it, I can tolerate it for a good cause.  I know what \"gritty\" is, as the product was described by another review, but this was NOT simply the texture of a sandy suspension.  Upon introducing this liquid evil into my alimentary orifice, I was immediately and forcibly hit with an instinctive, overwhelming impression that someone had tried to feed me a slurry of rough sawdust so thick that it was threatening my airway.  Nothing consumed me but the singular, urgent compulsion to spew this dark embodiment of horror back out (a first-time action in my entire 44 years' existence).  As the nearest liquid-capable container was the tub from which this vile, alien garbage came, I deposited it right back there, thinking in that split second, \"No loss;  I'll never try that again!\"  This was followed by a harsh, throat-clearing sound to try and force the mucky, fibrous residue from my larynx, another near-clearing spit, a run to the closest bathroom to flush and gargle with water, and the desperate use of a paper towel to somehow wipe the residue from my upper throat and tongue."}, {"helpful": 0, "rating": "2", "title": "Two Stars", "body": "garden of Life is expensive for what you get"}, {"helpful": 1, "rating": "5", "title": "Healthiest Fast Food Ever!", "body": "Ok, this is my favorite fast food!

If the bad taste had been the only issue I could have gotten around it and wouldn't be writing this review. But in short, it's the worst stuff I've ever tasted outside of drinking pure noni juice. It tastes like you might imagine swamp water with rotten veggies to taste and it smells just as bad. However, I really wanted to make this stuff work because I was impressed with the ingredients, but this company really needs to keep working on the formula. My height is 6'1\" and my weight is 230lbs, there's no way this is a \"meal replacement\" for me and I'm not a big eater. So after learning that it's not a meal replacement, I figured I would just drink it pre/post work out since it does contain 34g of protein per serving. I tried to put the mix into my shaker bottle through a funnel and the powder was so thick it got clogged up in the funnel and wouldn't go down, I had to use a rolled up paper plate to get it into my bottle. That should give you an idea of how thick this stuff is going to be when you try to mix it up with water. Here's the worst part: One serving requires two (2) scoops of the mix! The scoop that comes with this stuff is huge, twice the size of the standard scoop that comes with most whey protein powders i.e. EAS, ON, etc. After you put two level scoops of this powder into a glass containing 16oz of water, as directed by the instructions, you have a mixture with the consistency of mud! It doesn't dissolve well at all in water and it doesn't mix well either, it clumps up! If you let it stand for a few minutes hoping it will have a chance to dissolve better, it all settles at the bottom into one huge lump of nasty goo. The only way I would ever consider drinking this mixture again is if someone paid me at least $10 per glass to drink it. I wouldn't drink another glass of this junk for any less than $10 per glass. So it goes without saying that I would never spend my money to buy this product again."}, {"helpful": 0, "rating": "1", "title": "Not bad, actually taste okay with almond milk", "body": "Not bad, actually taste okay with almond milk.

There was nothing delicious about that Shakeology or that Vanilla Fresh or the Fiber sweep. It's also not enough food to sustain someone.  I ended up going off script day one after lunch. I followed it exactly by the book to start the day. But after I went to my regular weight lifting class and I was shaking because of lack of food in my system, I ate a protein bar and was ok.  By the end of day 2, I decided screw this and ate dinner. I was so starving I felt like a raging witch and there was no way I could go to work the next day without some sort of actual food in my body.  I've long believed that life and health is NOT about deprivation, but instead moderation and balance.  That is straight up deprivation.  Any weight loss I would've had by completely depriving myself for three days, would not have been sustained.  Eventually I'm going to eat a legit meal with some lean protein and actual substance and gain it back. So I decided to just scratch the whole thing and return to simply healthy choices and exercise. What a waste of money.  I did NOT get my money's worth or even close to it.  I cannot believe how much Shakeology costs for how  nasty it tastes....then again if they would've allowed me to mix it with Almond Milk like I do my own protein shakes maybe it would've been more tolerable."}, {"helpful": 0, "rating": "2", "title": "but I didn't like the product AT ALL", "body": "fast shipping is why I'm giving 2 stars, but I didn't like the product AT ALL!

I used the product detail on the canister to make the shake using 1 scoop of the mix, 8oz of 1%milk and a couple of ice cubes (taste great and very thick). I decided to switch things up and use just water instead of milk which cuts down the calorie intake and help with my lactose intolerance. I mix 16oz of water and 2 scoops of the shake mix. This mix was more filling (6 hours) and it adds up to be around the same amount of calories/less. Water has no calories so initially I am only taking in 220 calories and feel very much full. In addition I do use this as  meal replacement for breakfast while adding 1 banana each morning to this breakfast. Based on my google research 1 banana adds up to be 121 calories so in all for breakfast I only have 341 calories. Slim fast is a very great and cash efficient product for weight loss. I've tried other meal replacement Shakes (GNC) which are very good but also very costly. I suggest for any starters in weight loss, try slim fast first then progress to the more expensive products later if your trying to build muscle/etc. I am going to start using this as 2 meal replacements a day for one month in addition to 1 portion size regular meal and moderate exercise and I will return with my weight loss average."}, {"helpful": 2, "rating": "4", "title": "Slim-Fast", "body": "I very much enjoy Slim-Fast, the Creamy Vanilla with fruit added and the Chocolate Royale Shake.

I know that the pudding mix and gelatin mix add chemicals, but it\u2019s just a couple of tablespoons, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be harming my general health. Quite the opposite, in fact, because when I used to eat \u201creal\u201d food for breakfast and lunch, I had all sorts of stomach problems. After I started on the SlimFast, those problems went away completely. As a bonus, the almond milk and yogurt keep my calcium intake high enough that I don\u2019t have to take OTC calcium pills.

Every morning, I make two 20-ounce cups of SlimFast for the day in my Vita-Mix blender, refrigerating one for lunch.  I start with the Chocolate Royale and then add 2 cups of non-fat almond or cashew milk and 2 small cups of non-fat yogurt (vanilla or fruit flavor), along with 2 cups of ice and a handful of frozen strawberries. If you want it thicker and creamier, add a tablespoon of sugar-free pudding mix.  Sometimes I add a tablespoon of sugar-free Jello (fruit flavors) to change up the taste\u2014raspberry goes nicely with the chocolate, as does strawberry. I know that the pudding mix and gelatin mix add chemicals, but it\u2019s just a couple of tablespoons, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be harming my general health. Quite the opposite, in fact, because when I used to eat \u201creal\u201d food for breakfast and lunch, I had all sorts of stomach problems. After I started on the SlimFast, those problems went away completely. As a bonus, the almond milk and yogurt keep my calcium intake high enough that I don\u2019t have to take OTC calcium pills.

For those who say it does not keep them full, here are a couple of ideas that have worked for me.  When I worked in an office, I would take 1 can (now bottle) and 1 can of diet soda like Pepsi One or Coke Zero, to work each day and put them in the refrigerator.  At lunch I would pour half of each into a Solo cup, and slowly sip with a straw, keeping the rest seperate and still in the refrigerator.  Sometime after lunch, I would use the rest, usually finishing about 3:30 in the afternoon.  I never felt hungry.  Now that I work at home, this is what I like to do to cut down on the sugar, increase the fiber, and end up with twice the volume to drink (eat) for 222 calories:  Put 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of water in a blender along with 1/2 scoop of the Slim Fast (2 Tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons).  Add 2 Tablespoons of cocoa powder, 1 Tablespoon of malt powder and 1 Tablespoon of Splenda.  Grind 1 Tablespoon chia seeds in a coffee grinder, and add to blender.  Blend.  Add 1 cup of ice.  Blend again.  This gives you a little over 16 ozs. of thick, thick chocolate malt ice cream for 222 calories.  You have to eat this with a spoon.  Be sure to drink some extra water, because the chia seeds will continue to expand and keep you very full.  This cuts down the sugar in the Slim Fast by one half, and the chia adds a lot of fiber and also Omaga 3 fat(the good kind).  I get the bulk chia seeds and large malt powder at Amazon also."}, {"helpful": 1, "rating": "5", "title": "Love the taste!", "body": "I was looking for a good light meal supplement when I come across this product, Amazon's lightening deal helped me make up my mind on the purchase.

I actually have also been using Dymatize's ISO protein powder, it's only 100cal, 2gcarbs, 23gprotein, and no sugar. It's also a lot cheaper, you can get a 5 pound container for about $50. Slim fast has also increased their prices and decreased the portion sizes for some of the products.

Compared to the retail store size [9-11 oz depending...], my second purchase saved me about 33% from stores, which never seem to have this on sale. My first purchase of 2 was a steal. Seller had a $5 off any Slim-Fast! order exceeding $25, so on that purchase, my savings over retail store size closer to 45%. If you premix large batches in 1/2 or 1 gal. milk jugs and store in the fridge like I do, cut a 20 oz soda bottle off about 2\" from the top and invert into mouth of a milk jug. Soda bottle mouth perfectly fits in the mouth of a plastic milk jug, and voila, a funnel that is about 30% wider than the measuring scoop, so never a spill. Then take the \"funnel\" and plop it right back in the can with the scoop, until next time."}, {"helpful": 0, "rating": "3", "title": "HONESTLY...", "body": "I FEEL LIKE I GAINED MORE WEIGHT DRINKING IT.
