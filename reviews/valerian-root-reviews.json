I have looked at some of the similar products and comments about it, etc., and I can say for me, they work--for whatever reason.  I do take them an hour before I go to bed.  If I end up staying up a little later, it's not like you are so sleepy you can't stand up.  They seem to really start working when you lay down in bed and stop moving around, whether that is 40 minutes or an hour and 10 minutes.  I think you could potentially get dependent on these if you used them every night.  It would be terrible to forget how to go to sleep, so I don't use them every day.  I do not feel groggy in the morning, like I have with other PM products, that is one of the reasons I like valerian root.  I would recommend, if you're not sure buy one bottle and share it with someone until you're sure whether you think it helps.  I usually get up at least once in the night to use the bathroom, when I have taken this, I will go right back to sleep, even if I have to get up in an hour."}, {"title": "Restless Leg Syndrome.", "rating": "5", "helpful": 3, "body": "I have restless leg syndrome.

NOTE: this supplement is used for its sedative-like qualities. While not a drug one should be careful using it. It does affect motor function and cognitive reasoning. The effects are short lived making this a good way to get to sleep. Valerian root is to relax you into sleep, melatonin (if you choose to use with) is what will help keep one asleep. Understand, this promotes sleep, it doesn't knock one out. If you have certain sleep issues (major insomnia, sleep apnea or chronic pain that affects sleep) this will not make you sleep.

My vision was completely distorted I had no spacial awareness and my respiratory rate slowed and it was hard to breathe and I was was tripped out so hard I couldn't even stand up or walk around.

It can be taken at specific times daily, for overall assistance to stressful moods, and can be taken whenever you feel a meltdown coming on. It has never caused drowsiness in anyone I know, but it definitely does help you relax, so perhaps that is why so many people use it to help them sleep.

A good side to this is that if you take the 3 capsules the recommended 30 minutes before retiring, it will not make you drowsy, so if you have to delay your bedtime, you won't be fighting off sleep.

I still wake up during the night, but I drift back off pretty quickly.  What a relief!  My own experience has also been that I don't have to take these nightly once I get over a hump.

The back of the bottle says it promotes relaxation and helps sleep, it does. I suffer from anxiety, I get anxious during class presentations, group work, public speaking, anything that has to do with me being put on the spot. Not only do I suffer from anxiety but I also get the embarrassing symptoms that come with anxiety: sweating, rapid heartbeat, hot flashes, etc. It got to a point where I wanted to avoid going out to places so I wouldn't get anxious and begin sweating and feel embarrassed. I wasn't expecting too much from this pill, but I was surprised with the results. The recommended dosage is three pills, but since I take these before school, not bed, I decided to just take one to see how my body reacted to it. Well, I took one and about one hour later I realized my heart wasn't beating as fast as it usually does. I would get really nervous before this one class because the Prof would randomly call on people, but after taking this pill I felt relaxed. Yes, I was still worried about being called on, but my heart wasn't racing and I wasn't sweating! I didn't feel numb either, its hard to explain. I guess, for the first time in many years I felt \"normal\" like I didn't have to worry about the \"what ifs\" of sweating, anxiety, and nervousness. I was also worried this pill was going to make me sleepy but I didn't feel sleepy or drowsy all day. I don't want to become dependent on these pills so I take them only when I really feel like I need the help. I also only take one sometimes two if I feel super nervous, but I feel like one pill will suffice. I think if I were to take three then I might feel sleepy but not sure since I haven't taken more than two. The pills are big and STINK! Take them before you leave your house so you won't be embarrassed to open the bottle in public because the smell will travel quickly! haha. The smell is no big deal compared to what the pill actually does for you. Anyway, I recommend this pill for people who easily get anxious, nervous, have a hectic lifestyle, suffer from stress, etc. It worked for me and I'm so glad I found this because I didn't want to get prescribed medication."}, {"title": "Great health addition!", "rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "body": "Valerian root was introduced to me by an old woman with the longest gray hair in a hippie shop in Colorado.

He decided to take 4. WITH beer. And several hits of medical grade pot. Bad idea. He started to play guitar and really groove with the moment of the new nature herb of relaxation. An hour later he hit the floor. Four hours later he woke to loud deep flatulence coming from 3 directions. His nether region and the nether regions of both his dogs. You see when the redneck fell asleep he forgot to put them up off the table and for some reason the 2 dogs thought the rotting fish smell tablets smelled like cupcakes and ate them all. Very sad.

The redneck jumped up let the dogs out and felt an explosive power trying to escape his nether region. He then preceded to sit on the toilet for the rest of the night while nodding off every few minutes. Point is this stuff makes you sleepy, kind of like a Tylenol PM however does it calm nerves? No. Panic attacks? No. Its just an herb which has an effect on certain people to get a little sleepy. I cant make a total judgement on this product because I have no use of it, considering I take Xanax. I only observe what it has done for others.

I have used OTC sleep aids for years and experienced day time sleepiness and grogginess the morning after. With Driftoff, there was none of that! I \"drifted off\" in about 15 minutes and awoke without that grogginess. One of the other features that I absolutely love is that if you have to get up anytime during the night (which is what I do frequently) you can fall back asleep very shortly. The natural ingredients are a plus.

When using this to help me sleep I fill a tea ball with around a teaspoon of the Valerian root and steep it in very hot (just bellow boiling) water and keep it covered for 15 mins. Covering it is very important if you want to make it strong. When I use it during the day for general anxiety I don't cover it and steep for around 5 mins.
