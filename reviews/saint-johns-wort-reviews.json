Not a replacement for medical treatment but a true and tried herb in Europe that can take the blues out of the weather or a bad day. Nothing major but it works over time in a supportive way. I like it and this is a good version. One a day is sufficient for me and it lasts several month with 150 in there so quite economical. It is also supposed to help with PMS and menopause and has anti-inflammatory properties. In Germany they use St John's Wort oil against arthritis and other pains of the nerves topically. It is also used to treat skin cancer.

Also noticed some kidney soreness at the same time, as well as a constant need to drink more fluids. I'm not sure if that is due to the tea or something else in my life that has been affecting me, but it seems like this tea really helps with detoxification. IMO it tastes good too. I enjoy it without any sweeteners, and prefer it unsweetened. Also, one bad thing about the processing of the tea bags... The string is not stapled to the top. It's a manufacturing issue. The tea bags are NOT SEALED, and if you move it around too much when seeping, the loose crushed leaves will come out into the tea. The strings are not attached to the bags either. I just place the bags against the tea cup and the moisture allows the bags to cling to the side of the cups. I leave it for 10 mins or so, and then squeeze the liquid from the bags before removing them from the tea. Problem solved. It is still very worth the price and I will be purchasing again. Also, I have not had my period since drinking this tea, so I can't say anything about how the tea addresses the issue of PMS. I have bad PMS at times, with symptoms that include bad cramping and diarrhea, light-headedness, fatigue and low moods.

None of them have a pleasant taste, but with a little bit of honey, most are tolerable. My reason for 5 stars, all ingredients are Organic and it is a more natural way to treat people that are sick instead of taking medicine. I do believe that they all have benefits - helping a sore throat, helping you to breathe more easily (congestion), and help to alleviate cold symptoms. Do they cure sickness? NO - but neither does medicine, these help by increasing your liquid intake when you are sick.

I'm not sure if that is due to the tea or something else in my life that has been affecting me, but it seems like this tea really helps with detoxification. IMO it tastes good too. I enjoy it without any sweeteners, and prefer it unsweetened. Also, one bad thing about the processing of the tea bags... The string is not stapled to the top. It's a manufacturing issue. The tea bags are NOT SEALED, and if you move it around too much when seeping, the loose crushed leaves will come out into the tea. The strings are not attached to the bags either. I just place the bags against the tea cup and the moisture allows the bags to cling to the side of the cups. I leave it for 10 mins or so, and then squeeze the liquid from the bags before removing them from the tea. Problem solved. It is still very worth the price and I will be purchasing again. Also, I have not had my period since drinking this tea, so I can't say anything about how the tea addresses the issue of PMS. I have bad PMS at times, with symptoms that include bad cramping and diarrhea, light-headedness, fatigue and low moods. It has been sporadic, with some months symptom free, and very painful during some months.

I tried it with honey and had to choke it down quick! The after taste is the stevia root that gives it a mentholated lingering in the back of your throat. I've tried stevia before and hated every second of it. This is more of a mild taste that isn't overpowering and doesn't linger longer than I appreciate. With the honey it lingered like the Dickens!
