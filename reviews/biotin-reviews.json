According to many articles big amounts of biotin will cause break outs for some people. I was horrified! Took this bottle and threw it away! I'm still trying to get my skin back. Biotin works yes, but this particular extra strength might be too much for some people. As far as my personal experience I must give this a one star. And hopefully I save someone some headaches.

Also my little sister was taking them, and breaking out too (not as bad as me, but the worst she's ever had too) as soon as I did my research I ran to tell her. She has also informed me that her break outs aren't as bad anymore, since taking this pills off her daily routine. So it really wasn't just me having this effects. I now take an acne medication orally (pills) and in the ingredients it actually  contains biotin, it has 300 mcg that's a big difference from 10,000 mcg!!! I mean look at the diffrence!

I have very thick, curly/kinky hair that grows sooooooo slowly... it used to take me a whole year just to grow out 3 inches. Taking this biotin has helped add to my growth about a 1/2 inch per month. I used to do the japanese straight perms on my hair a long time ago, which left it so brittle and dry that any new growth was already weakened, eventually leading up to me having to chop off the severely damaged ends... thus my hair length remained the same all the time. Since then I have stopped the perms in hopes of growing my hair out longer, and started taking biotin and bamboo extract to give my scalp and hair a little boost. Compared to some other biotin supplements I have taken in the past, I like this one because it is a small tablet that is not hard to swallow, and it doesn't have that weird or gross taste if you don't get it down fast enough. The price and quantity per bottle is also excellent if your on a budget. I have searched for this particular biotin in 10,000 mcg at wal-mart and other drug stores, but never found more than 5,000 mcg. Amazon seems to be one of the few places that carries the Natrol brand in this biotin amount. I must say, if your one the people who is planning to combine this with bamboo extract, be aware of the possible breakouts. Everyone may react to it differently... I used to have very clear, healthy skin, but when I started taking this very high dose of biotin I saw some small breakouts starting to form on my lower cheeks... and when I added the bamboo extract, even MORE appeared all over my face =(  despite the increase in acne, I do like the benefits it has given my hair and will continue to take it.

That's what can cause the acne..and since biotin is water soluble your body can only absorb so much at one time.

So I relax/dye my own hair. I'm also a vegetarian (more on that later). So, after dying my hair a few too many times in a row my hair started breaking like crazy. No big deal I thought, nothing a deep conditioner can't fix. Two months ago I decided I wanted to ombr\u00e9 my hair, I didn't want to pay that much so I bought the one that comes In a box. Long story short, my hair couldn't handle the bleach and it became gummy like. I freaked out a decided to get a Brazilian treatment to add keratin to my weak hair. Keep in mind during all this my hair was shedding like crazy. I don't eat meat and I often forget to take my b vitamins; a vital nutrient if you don't want to go bald among other things. As soon as I get the keratin I remembered that for some reason Brazilian keratin makes me shed even more hair (I've done it a few times, same results). So after crying myself to sleep and thinking I was gonna end up looking like Bruce Willis I decided to take this Biotin. Right now I'm over half way done with my first bottle and omg! It works! My hair grew almost an inch in like six weeks. How do I know? Well, you can see the line where the keratin treatment stops and my hair is growing out. I'm also shedding less hair. If you don't want to break out, I advise you to drink plenty of water, I'm talking a lot! I got a few pimples the first two weeks so I drank even more water and that fixed the problem. I also added MSM another vitamin and it definitely helps. I take the two in the morning with my breakfast. Bottom line is: if you hair is shedding like crazy or you are trying to grow your hair this might help you. Plus is super cheap. Be patient, I didn't see any results during the the first couple of weeks and now 70 something days later I can totally see the difference! Also biotin is super safe, your body discards whatever the excess. I wouldn't advise  taking more than one a day since it would be a waste.

They're very small, fairly cheap and has the high amount of mcg I wanted. Also, there's about 100 here so they last me for about 3 1/2 months. The most important part, though, is: IT WORKS! I got my first bottle in September 2013 and wow it has been amazing! It hasn't even been a year yet and already my hair is long enough to reach where my bra rests on my back when previously it only reached my shoulders. It's also made it healthier and stronger.

I wanted to try something to get my hair back to the way it was, so I picked this up. I've actually only had it for about three weeks, but I've been taking it everyday.  Within the first two weeks, I noticed that my hair was shedding a lot less than it normally does, maybe a few strands compared to the clumps, and it has actually grown a little bit. Biotin also helps strengthen your nails as well, so my nails are actualy growing rapidly (and are a little sharp...actually scratched myself the other day and it left a decent scrape HAHA).  I'll continue monitoring my progress on this pill and see how it goes. My advice would be to take a picture of your hair before you start taking it, front and back, and take a picture every week to monitor your progress. I've already noticed a difference.

Even the bottles are closer to identical with same color cap. The biotin I used to take was $50 for a 60 tablet bottle. They worked but way too expensive. Now we have these at about $6 a bottle.

Well much to my surprise when I received both within these three weeks my hair has gotten thicker and healthier and much more shiny and OMGG I love this stuff. This biotin and MSM has helped my self esteem about my hair as the bald spots once seen filled in and got so thick and long that when I drive with the window down now my hair touches my neck and I think its a bug on my neck. lol So yes Im  lovin the new ME and feelin so good and no longer feeling insecure about my hair.

I do believe it is helping my hair to grow... don't get me wrong though, it has not been a miracle pill like some people are saying it is. I have very thick, curly/kinky hair that grows sooooooo slowly... it used to take me a whole year just to grow out 3 inches. Taking this biotin has helped add to my growth about a 1/2 inch per month. I used to do the japanese straight perms on my hair a long time ago, which left it so brittle and dry that any new growth was already weakened, eventually leading up to me having to chop off the severely damaged ends... thus my hair length remained the same all the time. Since then I have stopped the perms in hopes of growing my hair out longer, and started taking biotin and bamboo extract to give my scalp and hair a little boost. Compared to some other biotin supplements I have taken in the past, I like this one because it is a small tablet that is not hard to swallow, and it doesn't have that weird or gross taste if you don't get it down fast enough. The price and quantity per bottle is also excellent if your on a budget. I have searched for this particular biotin in 10,000 mcg at wal-mart and other drug stores, but never found more than 5,000 mcg. Amazon seems to be one of the few places that carries the Natrol brand in this biotin amount. I must say, if your one the people who is planning to combine this with bamboo extract, be aware of the possible breakouts. Everyone may react to it differently... I used to have very clear, healthy skin, but when I started taking this very high dose of biotin I saw some small breakouts starting to form on my lower cheeks... and when I added the bamboo extract, even MORE appeared all over my face =(  despite the increase in acne, I do like the benefits it has given my hair and will continue to take it. Drink plenty of water! that will help reduce breakouts if you get them. Vitamins and supplements work best when you stay hydrated...

I drastically lost a lot of weight so I stopped taking it. Several years later, older and a few pounds heavier I decided that side effect would be welcomed lol. However, this time around it affected my skin drastically, I suddenly had awful cystic acne after taking this for a few weeks, I hadn't made any other changes so it was definitely associated with this. After reading online, I knew that acne was a side effect but increased water intake and taking it sparsely initially would help with prevention but unfortunately that didn't help me. Can't speak to its effectiveness as I didn't take it long enough to see a difference. I probably should've started with a lower mcg but I thought taking it once every other day would be enough, I'm too afraid to try now otherwise. So be wary, with all the reviews I don't doubt it works for hair growth, but I'd rather have clear skin instead of long luscious hair =[. Good news was that the acne cleared up about a few weeks after I stopped.

I am taking several vitamin supplements right now so I can't say this one specifically is doing this or that.

Always read reviews and go to a company like this. Never read an article that mentions a celebrity or Dr. Oz being you're almost 100% going to get something that isn't what they claim.( tip from experience: these fake products often appear as an article on a news site online but if you click on top let's say entertainment or sports you're not directed to that specific section. Point being fake article, fake site, fake product). Not to mention they'll charge your credit card as they please. This company (Natrol) is legit and people need to educate themselves of the frauds out there so they stop taking our money and putting God knows what in our bodies. Companies like Natrol deserve that money put into their business being they are what they claim to be and sell real vitamins and supplements in my opinion. I don't know or work for company but I've been overweight and tired my entire life. I've put countless dollars into scam companies' pockets and now only buy from a few select companies, Natrol being one of them. Another tip from a friend I just got for those of you who are overweight like me and have been scammed and lost a lot of money looking for something that will help.  Look into military diet, haven't tried it yet but apparently it's very specific food one day and next day eat normal. I'm going to give it a try. You're supposed to lose ten pounds in a week and my friend said her co-worker lost 14 pounds in two weeks but admitted to cheating on second weight.

That's what can cause the acne..and since biotin is water soluble your body can only absorb so much at one time. It just goes to show how we all think that if it helps with us looking better then that means we should take an absurd amount of it at one time.

I've taken Biotin supplements in the past w/out great results, but I was spotty with taking them (not the product's fault, but my fault, of course) and eventually gave up. After finding this product, I committed to taking the recommended dosage religiously and it definitely works for me. My nails usually are usually kept short because they peel and split (except when I was pregnant and had super hormones flowing through me) but now that I've been taking this Biotin supplement, I have pregnancy nails again. I feel like a freaking super hero. Like, maybe this is what Wolverine feels like, minus the violence. I find myself tapping on surfaces w/my nails because it's a fascinating sensation to have these strong suckers grow out so long and healthy. Clearly, this supplement has left quite the impression on me. I initially took it for my hair loss (pregnancy can do a serious number on one's hair) and though I'm not seeing as fantastic an effect on my hair, I am seeing more regrowth and more quickly so it's looking up.

I don't ever fall for any reviews where someone claims that the product performed a miracle within 7 days or even 14 days. Supplements don't work that fast, especially when you're talking about hair and nails. You have to use a product for a long time before you'll see any substantial difference in your nails, because the old damaged nails have to grow out before the new, better nails can be seen.

I was pretty desperate to keep what hair I have and stop it from falling out so I did some research and Amazon had these bad boys as a \"best seller\". So, I did what any 25 year old losing her hair would do: I bought them! I've been taking them for about a month now (twice a day, one AM and one PM) and my hair has not only been growing like a weed, I have noticed a tremendous decrease in how much hair I'm losing. Normally when showering I would take out globs of hair but it's only down to a few strands now. An added bonus is that I've noticed my nails have also been growing faster and I haven't been having as many acne breakouts as I normally would (yes, 25 year old's still get acne).

My hair is also slow to grow, that's just how it is, but I have noticed some improvement. The only complaint I'd have is that there is Carrageenan in this product. I did some research and didn't read many positives to this ingredient and heard it can lead to digestive issues over a period of time (consuming everyday, too)  So I would like to ask, why is it necessary to have this in your product?

I took milk thistle and drank a lot of water to offset the skin issues it caused, but I was still breaking out. I always weigh between 130-135lbs for the last 16 year except when I was pregnant, so going up to 142lbs was out of the ordinary. About 2 weeks after I stopped taking it, the weight just came off. While I was taking it all the hair on my body grew very fast, as well as eyebrows and eyelashes. I can't find anything about this online but my teeth which are always a few shades away from white (my dentist and hygienists always bawk at my inquiries about whitening, saying my teeth are already white) got a bit more yellow while I was taking it, which drove me crazy since my teeth are very sensitive and I have fewer whitening options. I think they are returning to their natural color now, I began using a whitening mouthwash. Overall this product does work, but it isn't worth all of the unwanted side effects in my opinion. The pills are very small like everyone says and pleasant enough to take. I did feel a little cracked out the first few days I took it, but that went away.

So here goes, since using the Biotin I have noticed thickness and less breakage so, stronger and fuller hair. As far, as growth I'm going to go with very little if ANY.

I took milk thistle and drank a lot of water to offset the skin issues it caused, but I was still breaking out. I always weigh between 130-135lbs for the last 16 year except when I was pregnant, so going up to 142lbs was out of the ordinary. About 2 weeks after I stopped taking it, the weight just came off. While I was taking it all the hair on my body grew very fast, as well as eyebrows and eyelashes. I can't find anything about this online but my teeth which are always a few shades away from white (my dentist and hygienists always bawk at my inquiries about whitening, saying my teeth are already white) got a bit more yellow while I was taking it, which drove me crazy since my teeth are very sensitive and I have fewer whitening options. I think they are returning to their natural color now, I began using a whitening mouthwash. Overall this product does work, but it isn't worth all of the unwanted side effects in my opinion.

My nails normally grow quickly, but they used to break almost as soon as I got them to the length that I wanted. It took at least a few weeks for everything to start working, but my nails now feel tough (I used to be able to bend them pretty easily) and I haven't had one break at least in the past two weeks, and I'm sitting here typing with my long nails as I type! This is the thing that makes me happiest, though I had initially purchased this to try to help with strengthening my hair so that it will actually grow and retain length. Speaking of hair, though I hadn't noticed initially, my boyfriend and some of my friends say that my hair has definitely gotten longer. I can't say for sure that it's because of the biotin because I've also been wearing more protective styles lately to try to fend off breakage as well, but I do think that the combination of this supplement plus me trying more low maintenance styling has helped since my hair normally doesn't show growth as quickly as it has now. I have at least an additional 1-2 inches since clipping my ends at the end of December. The best thing also is that one bottle will last for months, and thanks to Zenwise contacting me to send me an additional bottle for free, I'm set for at least half the year, so that was greatly appreciated.

Therefore when I find a product I really like, I feel compelled to write one. I have used other brands of Biotin before. My main goal was to grow my nails longer and make them stronger. All of the Biotin I have purchased has done a wonderful job with nail growth. I was also hoping to see hair growth. I have not measured my hair, but it appears to be stronger and there is clearly less shedding. The reason I wrote the review is that I have experienced a very noticeable difference in my complexion that was unexpected. I had read other reviews that stated a similar result. However, as I had taken Biotin in the past with no such result, I was not expecting this. Despite being far past my teen years, I would have occasional break outs (a variety of possible reasons, but mostly hormonal I believe). I am African American with chocolate brown skin. The break outs would almost always leave a dark mark of my face where the blemish appeared. My skin looks flawless in makeup but as an adult, I was always very disappointed that it was not equally flawless without makeup. Just based on the remarkable difference in my complexion in less than a month, I feel hopeful that I am well on my way to that flawless skin. I plan to buy this product again, just based on this result alone. I have changed nothing in my regular skin care routine, diet or lifestyle, so it has to be the Biotin. I will continue to use it faithfully according to directions until I complete the bottle.

I was surprised at how well they work. They taste much better than other gummy, fruit flavor vitamins (though those worked just as well, they had a bit of a chalky taste, which these do not). My hair will always be naturally thin, but it is now about twice as thick as it used to be--and I need everything I can get. It is definitely falling out much less. Small downside, it is also growing much faster, which was not really what I intended, and I have to get it cut more to keep it short, but worth the trade-off for me. It is hard to take a picture that really shows the difference in my hair, but my nails are easier to show. Like my hair, they are much stronger, break less and are growing faster.
