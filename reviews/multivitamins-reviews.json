So I went on Amazon, found and bought these opti-men vitamins. I've been using these for about a week now but I definitely get an equal if not better energy boost than I was on my b-complex. Not only that but, I undoubtedly notice having more focus when taking these which really helps me sit down and write an amazon review.

I have chosen the one-a-day version because it does not load me up with the B vitamins excessively.  I have had negative experiences with high levels of B vitamins.

They don't have any long term info on this stuff. They say all natural but I have never seen a pill growing from a plant or a tree so how natural can they be. You have to educate yourself on these things you are putting in your body. I started using these (men's version) long ago and did not see any benefits other than it turning my pee a neon color. I did 6 yrs worth of research of different nutrients, minerals, ingredients, and so on and realized that everything that company's were putting in food, vitamins, and so forth was dangerous or they really didn't know what it did long term. I quit taking them for a long time but started using them again but only took them for about two weeks because I have had 9 back surgeries and was trying to give my body a little extra while I am healing. Take Gatorade for example. They put Brominated Vegetable Oil in it. B.V.O., which is banned in over 100 other country's, can cause memory loss, fatigue. loss of muscle control, tremors, pupil constriction, and can also alter your Serum Chloride which is very carefully controlled by your kidneys. When this is altered it can cause major problems with your central nervous system and can cause you to have large amounts of carbon dioxide in your blood. I could go on and on, but, because ALL company's are NOT required to list all the ingredients in their products, which is completely legal in accordance with the F.D.A., you never know what you are getting! This is exactly why we are having an epidemic of new diseases that we didn't have 50 yrs ago. To be honest creatine is the only supplement that is classified safe and risk free under 5 grams a day and that is backed by long term studies. Creatine is naturally found in your body, all meat but higher concentrations in red meat, and was discovered in 1832 and has SO many health benefits. They are using creatine to treat neuromuscular, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases (arthritis, congestive heart failure, Parkinson's disease, disuse atrophy, gyrate atrophy, McArdle's disease, Huntington's disease, miscellaneous neuromuscular diseases, mitochondrial diseases, muscular dystrophy, and neuroprotection) and it can also increase brain function. I started my wife on a creatine regiment and she started dropping weight like crazy. Unfortunately most women wont take creatine because they think it will make them bulky. FALSE!!! In order to get bulky you have to be eating enough calories to gain which is a minimum of 18 calories per pound of body weight. It you are not eating enough calories to put on weight then you wont bulk regardless of what you take. You cant gain if you don't eat! Also, only do free weights and no machines. For the same reason as creatine women do not do free weights. They think it will bulk them up. It doesn't matter if you are on machines or free weights weight is weight! But, free weights use stability muscles to keep the weights from moving and machines do not. Free weights will also give women (and men) great shape because you get an even work out. Machines will make you have one side stronger than the other because you will pull harder with one side when the going gets tough. Free weights make you push with both limbs equally.  Anyway, to get back to the point. The only reason people \"feel\" great after taking vitamins is because they have eaten terrible all their lives and a lack of exercise then they start eating good and working out and taking a vitamin and think the vitamin is what's doing it. Or, it is the placebo effect. They start a vitamin thinking its going to be so good then the brain reacts to the anticipation!

So anyway, I got a really good gym membership, and decided to start doing cross fit after a couple months \u201ctransitioning\u201d into a fit person at the gym. I started working with a trainer, and I was just barely getting through my workouts, after talking to him though, he said I probably needed some multivitamins, as running should have made my endurance much better than it was. I found the Animal Pak on a fitness blog (did I really just write that?) and came to Amazon to sift through the reviews. I found most people\u2019s responses to be helpful,and useful, but I still wasn\u2019t convinced. I consulted my trainer, who begrudgingly told me that he also uses the Animal Pak. Sold. That guy is ripped. So I started taking them, and within a few days of taking them, I not only felt better while working out, I also felt better throughout the day, and generally had more energy and felt much healthier.

Vitamin B6 is extremely important but even though it is water soluble chronic high doses can cause neurological problems. Athletes should also definitely be sure to get enough calcium but IMO 2 grams in supplement form may be too much for people as excess calcium increases the risk for unwanted calcium deposits. I would feel a bit better about this quantity of calcium if this product included Vitamin K2 which most users probably don't supplement with separately. I would think that many of the users of this supplement are already eating very healthy and getting at least some Vitamin B6 and calcium in their diet already. The amino acid complex seems a bit unnecessary to me since most people taking this supplement are probably already supplementing with most of these amino acids anyway. Overall I do think this is a good supplement as far as ingredients go and at just one pack/day I'm not really concerned about the B6 or calcium since I am quite athletic and supplement with K2.

I also personally think that the serving size of 2 packs/day should be taken with caution. Vitamin B6 is extremely important but even though it is water soluble chronic high doses can cause neurological problems. Athletes should also definitely be sure to get enough calcium but IMO 2 grams in supplement form may be too much for people as excess calcium increases the risk for unwanted calcium deposits. I would feel a bit better about this quantity of calcium if this product included Vitamin K2 which most users probably don't supplement with separately. I would think that many of the users of this supplement are already eating very healthy and getting at least some Vitamin B6 and calcium in their diet already. The amino acid complex seems a bit unnecessary to me since most people taking this supplement are probably already supplementing with most of these amino acids anyway. Overall I do think this is a good supplement as far as ingredients go and at just one pack/day I'm not really concerned about the B6 or calcium since I am quite athletic and supplement with K2. The only other suggestions I have when taking this would be to take with food. This supplement did seem to upset my stomach a bit even with food.

While I am sure this was the golden standard for men's sport vitamins when it was first released many years ago, this is no longer the case. I give the product two stars because it is, for all intents and purposes, a complete vitamin with more than enough of anything you could possibly be lacking. However, they could certainly simplify the product by reducing the number of pills each pack comes with. I now use Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men instead. The ON product simply has fewer pills (3 compared to the more than 10 in Animal Pak) and is still an outstanding multivitamin. Trust me, at first you won't mind swallowing that many pills per day, but I already have to take quite a few other medications and supplements and it is simply too much effort, time, and swallowing.

Mom, Dad, Grandpa, Grandma, Uncle Ben and even Little Sally should take a multi-vitamin to give all the vitamin and minerals your body doesnt get from what you eat.

If you cant take 11 pills on a daily basis then your not commited enough. Dont worry your not alone, there are lots of people like you that complain about it \" oh my gosh, 11 pills a day. This is madness.\" There are plenty of dedicated weightlifters like me that will gladly take that Pak everyday without complaining so we can get big.

The P90X product provides 30-days worth for $50. Each day is contained in an individual packet and has six (6) average-sized cellulose capsules. I was taking three (3) with breakfast and three (3) with lunch. Reading the label on the Animal Pak before I bought it (GNC and the Universal websites have PDF's of the label available), I knew that I'd be taking two (2) paks per day (the recommended use during training, I think P90X qualifies). With 44 packets per container, that's 22-days worth for $25 on Amazon. Not quite half the price, but still some significant savings. The Animal Pak is lacking some of what the P90X supplement had, but it also had more BCAA's and other good stuff. I'd generally call it a wash in that regard. What really got me, and why I just can't rate this product any higher is the sheer number of pills in each pak. Three extra-large pills, three large pills, two medium pills, and three small pills. Yep, that's 11 pills PER PAK. I went from three per meal to 11 per meal, and the Animal Pak pills are the hard press-formed pills instead of the soft cellulose capsules.

This is very different than most multivitamins, where they put minimal amounts of each ingredient in just so that they can say it's there. I actually read a book by Mike Mathews, the owner of this supplement company that talked about different training and nutritional guidelines, and was very impressed by the fact that he didn't plug his nutritional company a single time throughout the course of the book. I've heard really good things about selenium, grapeseed extract, and rhodiola rosea, and this vitamin has them in clinically effective doses.

I started taking a whole foods based vitamin and saw a pretty significant improvement in how I felt with a fairly short time, noticing that I was waking up less with nighttime pain that I used to take an NSAID to get rid of and make it through the night.  However, the manufacturer of those vitamins stopped making them and, fortunately, in searching fro a replacement I found these.  I say fortunately because New Chapter Only One Whole Food Multivitamins are actually better than the whole food vitamins I had been taking.  With those, I still had to take NSAIDs at least a couple of nights during the week and also had to take them during the day to get rid of pain.  While I would not say I have been able to totally eliminate NSAIDs for pain, the New Chapter vitamins have definitely further, and significantly decreased the number of time during any given week or month that I need to take anything for pain.  Another benefit is that with my other whole food based vitamins, the recommended dose was two a day.  With New Chapter Only One, as the name implies, it is only one a day.

Shipping is also pretty speedy. With the latest delivery, they came in a refrigerated box for the first time. I'm now knocking off a star because these vitamins do not need to be sent in a refrigerated box, at least in San Francisco where it never gets hot enough to damage the vitamins. The two plastic ice packs and two cushioned plastic pads put into the box to create a cooler effect seem like a total waste. While some of the vitamins in the complex *might* get damaged because they *might* pass through high temperature during delivery in other parts of the country, they are mostly sugar, so it's not like they're the highest quality vitamin anyway.  I would rather not increase my carbon footprint to such an extent just to get folic acid, so I will likely purchase in bulk (2-3 bottles per shipment) or straight from the corner drugstore in the future.

I like that they're organic too. Beyond that though ... I think my fondness for them decreases significantly. Each gummy bear is coated in sugar, which I suppose I wouldn't mind so much except that the serving size for the multivitamin is 3 gummy bears, i.e. 4 grams of sugar, per day. If it were that by itself, maybe I wouldn't complain, except that if you look at the supplement facts on the back of the bottle, you'll see that this multivitamin is lacking in some pretty significant areas: Vitamin D, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. (This multivitamin contains only 1% of the recommended daily value for Calcium!!) To compensate for these shortages, you'd probably have to manage your child's diet pretty carefully, or supplement with other Yummi Bears Organics products (probably the company's goal), which will add on extra gummies, i.e. more sugar. When all is said and done, I'd probably end up giving up giving my kid 7-8 gummy bears, or 12 grams of sugar, just to get a complete regimen of vitamins/minerals. (I wonder what that much sugar does to a 25-pound toddler ... and his teeth.) To be fair, I don't think Yummi Bears Organics is the only manufacturer to do this, and they do offer a sugar-free option (although its daily values are a little less than these and I've read critical reviews of the flavor), but it still detracts from my overall satisfaction that I have to consider buying three different products just to give my son the recommended daily intake of vitamins and minerals. Additionally, this multivitamin packs way more (up to 225%) of some vitamins/minerals than what is necessary (for example, it provides 200% of the daily value of Vitamin E), but if you do your research, you'll find that more is not always better for you, and in fact can, in some cases, be harmful instead. I fail to see the point in adding more than 100% of the daily value to any vitamin. I wish there was a tasty organic multivitamin on the market now that provided amounts closer to the recommended daily value, but I have not found one yet, so I guess I'm stuck with these for now.
