I decide to try that and save some money and only 2 pills per day.  After several days, knee pain returns ...though on the mild side.

I also know that different things work for different people so don't give up trying to find what works for you.  Over a year ago I tore the meniscus in my left knee. It was a small tear but painful. I developed a baker's cyst and long story short, the cyst ruptured and I ended up in ER unable to put any weight on that leg.  I was sent to an orthopedic surgeon diagnosed the cyst, the tear and mild arthritis.  He gave me a shot of cortisone and got me mobile again.  I was out of state so the goal was to get me home.  I left his office with no instructions to get into physical therapy when I returned home to rebuild strength and mobility so I stayed off it as much as possible. Little did I know that was only making things worse.  Three weeks later I was back in agony so ended up seeing another surgeon who sent me to PT for several months.  I got back on my feet but still had much stiffness and pain with limited mobility.  Then just as I was moving back to health, I fell and injured my other knee.  So I was back to square one but now with both knees.  I was not ready for surgery emotionally or physically.  My physical therapist recommended glucosamine and collagen in addition to PT, so I started researching and learned about the importance of using glucosamine along with Hyaluronic Acid.  After trying several very expensive and ineffective products I found myself reading the reviews of Joint Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM complex.  I read them all and because of the many testimonials I decided to try.  Several reviewers had said to give the supplement 3 weeks to work.  I was in such misery I honestly thought I would have to suffer the rest of my life, but at around 2 weeks I noticed a remarkable difference - ease at getting up and down, no pain when walking. At three weeks I had no pain and much less stiffness. Now at over 3 months of using this product, I am still pain free.  I am even doing stairs again.

And that the glucosamine in your body helps to keep your cartilage healthy. However, as you get older, your levels of this compound begin to drop, which can lead to the gradual breakdown of the joint. In my family we are very physically active and my older relatives have had a lot of knee cartilage issues as well as arthritis in other joints in the body. As I am getting older, I recognize that my body won't heal itself as quickly and I've used Glucosamine/Chondroitin on and off for years. I am of the opinion that my joints will benefit more from a preventative use of this product than if I waited until I had no cartilage left in my knees.  I have read that if you still have cartilage that this product can help to rebuild new cartilage, however if your knees are bone on bone (like my mother) you cannot rebuild cartilage and so this product is far less effective.  When I suggest this product to my mother, she does find it helps slightly, however with bone on bone she inevitably gets water on the knee, inflammation and a slew of issues that even this product cannot resolve.  I on the other hand experience the occasional knee pain, from skiing moguls or running hills and find that this product helps to keep my knees feeling pain-free and hopefully helping to keep my cartilage strong yet rubbery."}, {"rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "title": "Just ordered and started these, not sure if they ...", "body": "Just ordered and started these, not sure if they will work but will hopefully stay on track and update at a later date!!

However, I am a little to heavy to have the operation done safely, just yet. I am working on losing the extra pounds, but in the meantime I have to put up with bone grinding on bone pain. Until I can have the operation, this joint supplement helps keep the pain in my knees tolerable. As a former distance runner, I was very familiar with using DMSO to relieve bone pain when confronted with irritation caused by bones grinding together. When I discovered the similarities between MSM and DMSO, I HAD to try it to see if it worked. It does. It is not a miracle cure for the cartilage missing from my knees, but it does help keep things tolerable. The fact that this product has MSM combined with the ever popular glucosamine and chondroitin combination that has become a staple for arthritis sufferers everywhere, is a huge plus in my book.

He said I'd wear the new knees out in a few years with the level of activity that I engage in and instead, he said I should lose 30 pounds (probably a good idea) and be proactive with treatment, meaning that I should ice the knees often, stretch more, and do more low impact activity.  He also said I should get serious about my diet and eat like a vegan and take some kind of Joint Support.  So, I'm doing all he said.  My weight is down to 205 (from 225) and I've been taking this supplement for 2 months now.  I can't say with 100% certainty that it is helping my knee pain. I really can't.  I emailed the company and they suggested that I take 2 in the morning and 1 at night.  I usually exercise in the morning, and every day, without fail, my knees absolutely ache- but I plow through it and am hoping that when my weight is down to 185 that I'll at least be in less pain.  So do they help?  I don't notice any difference after I take them or before.  My knees always ache.  But with all due respect, maybe my knees are at the level that even this product can't help!  The company told me that I could take this product long term, but that some people build up an immunity or resistance to it, so I was planning on discontinuing it when I get to 185 pounds and then to see if I actually notice anything.

I bought this product for my dog (he is a lab/ husky mix) after researching many glucosamine products, comparing the dosage to that of dog products. My vet said the ingredients were \"perfect\" . When I started him on it his arthritis was so bad that he couldn't walk at all, just barely able to relieve himself and could not go up or down steps without me practically lifting him. He could not get up from a laying position without help and his legs trembled when he was standing. This is not an exaggeration. He could only stand for a minute or so. When I took him to the vet  I  thought she was going to have him put to sleep. But she put him on aspirin, a pain killer, and glucosamine. The glucosamine was my idea but the vet said the ingredients in this particular brand were canine safe. I have been giving it to my 75 pound dog for four weeks. He no longer takes the pain killer. He is now able to get up and down entire flights of steps all by himself, can swim to retrieve balls and take walks. I can't say for sure that the glucosamine is the reason since he is still on aspirin as well but I think it must be helping and I plan to keep him on it permanently. I am hopeful that I can decrease the aspirin to a minimal dose and rely on the much healthier glucosamine. I am amazed at his improvement, to me it is miraculous. I am so grateful for this product.
