[{"body": "I am getting ready to purchase a second bottle and thought I would write a review. My wife suffers from generalized anxiety disorder which started one day out of nowhere and was having trouble finding ways to cope through it. She was placed on all types of psychotropic medications and all they did was turn her into a numb zombie and caused horrible side effects. It got to the point where she had to quit her job, was scared to drive or grocery shop and even to stay alone with our children. She would call for emergency assistance at least once a week because her heart rate would go up to almost 200 beats per minute, she'd get dizzy and her chest would hurt really badly when having an attack. It was horrible and causing a ton of stress on her heart. After doing some research, we came across an article about natural solutions to cure anxiety. L-Theanine was on the list. I purchased this brand because of the good reviews in June and she would take 2-3 a day. It helped a lot but she still had trouble with staying out of sudden fight or flight mode. Two weeks later, she added chelated magnesium 133mg, 5-HTP 100mg, vitamin D-3 w/coconut oil 5,000iu, and lithium orotate 5mg. Along with practicing relaxation techniques, she takes one of each pill in the morning and its been like a miracle. She is back to her old self again and more focused and energetic. She has been off all her psychotropic medications and has not had a unmanageable attack in over a month. No more racing heart, dizziness, and countless er and doctor visits. Later, we also found out that she had an severely infected root canal that she did not even feel and that may have been the culprit as she's always been a very laidback person all her life so her sudden change just did not make sense to either of us. Infections causes your body to become under a lot of stress so take care of yourselves and don't just take an anxiety diagnosis with a grain of salt. Once it starts, it is a beast to contend with but there's always a root cause. Work on the figuring out the root causes and if you can, leave the psychotropic medications alone because they only cover up the real issue(s).", "title": "Life Changing!", "rating": "5", "helpful": 3}, {"body": "Definitely calming!!

I tried going through my healthcare plan first to seek treatment but the amount of hurdles in the way just to get a prescription were incredibly discouraging and time-consuming. After four months, I was fed up with the lack of progress being made and decided to look into alternatives instead. A friend of mine who has social anxiety disorder suggested I look into nootropics and, after a few weeks of reading up on various supplements, I put my doubts aside and decided that a L-Theanine and 5-HTP combo looked the most promising.

I have issues with high cortisol and anxiety in the evenings, so I usually take my dose of this and phosphatidylserine around dinner time. The phosphatidylserine works to blunt the effects of high cortisol (anxiety) and the L-theanine is sort of an enhancement to lowering my anxiety.

One morning while checking my email, I felt this very odd, panic-like sensation. I actually thought I was having a heart attack. My pulse was racing and I had this helpless sensation. I had to get up and move, frantically walking around thinking I was about to pass out . I was waiting for my heart to stop. Yes, this was the scariest moment of my life! The only difference in everything I've done up to this point was this supplement. I grabbed some organic beat tablets and drank a whole lot of water to flush my system. As I write this, I can still feel that sensation creeping up, then going away, but to a lesser degree. Had I not been flushing my system all morning, in all honesty, I think I'd be in the emergency room.

Capsules like these are more likely to lose potency from exposure to air or dampness. Theanine is also fat-soluble, not water soluble. SR's delivers its theanine inside a sturdy sealed gel-like capsule in a coconut oil carrier. When considering the price of a theanine supplement, you must consider how much of the theanine will actually be absorbed and available to the body. SR packages its theanine in a way that guarantees an optimal dosage. I have been an avid supplements user for many years and I carefully research any product before buying.

I immediately stopped using Suntheanine and my adverse side effects went away within 2 days.  For 3 days now, I have not used Suntheanine at bedtime and was able to sleep through the night without RLS pain, but did have very mild RLS pain at my usual 6:00-6:30 in the morning time slot.

So I went to google for help. That's when I stumbled upon theanine. After reading countless reviews, I decided to order me one bottle. I wake up this morning feeling like I didn't sleep, had no energy, and not in the usual happy mood I'm always in. My package arrived today and I immediately took one. After about thirty minutes or so my entire mood lifted and my energy is back. I am a firm believer in this. The most important thing to me is that it's ALL natural.

A busy classroom was overload for him, and a mild head injury on the playground made his symptoms worse. A small classroom still posed challenges with frequent time-outs due to frustration/tantrums, impulsivity, and so on. After reading that l-theanine had good results in a trial with 8-12yr old boys with ADHD, I started him on this supplement. Two weeks later, I received an email from his teacher:\" I don't know what you are doing differently at home, but he is doing so much better these last two weeks, and he seems better able to use the tools we are teaching.\" For the first time he received 100% on a behavior chart, and his scores are consistently higher (upper 80's and 90's) than previously. He is able to choose to take himself to a quiet area when he feels overloaded, rather than acting out. At home, if I am late on his afternoon dose, I see impulsivity problems and obnoxious or oppositional behavior. 20-40 minutes later he is calm and better behaved. I have tried this myself, and there is no \"drugged\" feeling. It just supports better brain function if there is a need in this area, with no side effects. If your child can't swallow capsules, there is a suntheanine ( same thing) chewable tablet that tastes like citrus. We started with those with equally good results, although  you need two tablets for the same dose. I can't say it has been a total cure, but certainly has made life so much better for my son and the rest of us, without the concerns of medications. I recommend Daniel Amen's book Healing the Six Types of ADHD for additional suggestions of dietary and other supports for you or your child's particular symptoms.

Shout out to BulkSupplements for yet another really good product. I ordered their caffeine pills which work really effectively but I'm starting to just come to terms that my body doesn't work well on caffeine but this stuff is a total different story. So most people say caffeine and l-theanine goes perfectly together and as I'm writing this I used both of them two hours ago and can see why they say that. Caffeine stimulants you while theanine calms you down and together they cause a really balanced, zen-like affect. Me personally, as I stated above, I think I can do without the caffeine and tomorrow I'm gonna take the theanine by itself and give my review on it separately but as of right now I can already tell this stuff is the real deal. I'm a very depressed person but this stuff makes me feel awesome. As I told my girlfriend, the supplement makes me feel like I drunk 50 cups of green tea and meditated for an hour straight! Very clear minded, calm and happy, yet focused and alert at the same time. For people like me who are depressed and people like my girlfriend who deal with severe anxiety, this stuff is the wonder drug. For others who don't deal with as much stress as we do can still benefit from it but don't expect a whole lot being that your demand for it isn't as high as ours but you will still feel the effects none the less. I can tell I'm gonna get a good amount of sleep later already. This stuff has me excited.

I noticed that when I stack it with caffeine in a 2:1 ratio, then I feel more clear headed.  It has hardly any taste.

I took it on the day of my teacher evaluation and noticed a significant decrease in anxiety from past evaluations.  I also take it by itself at night for relaxation/sleep.  My sister now uses it for anxiety, especially in social situations.  I would have given it 5 stars if it came with a measuring scoop, as other brands seem to supply.  I really feel like each powder needs a dedicated scoop to discourage contamination, which I had to purchase separately.  The package isn't bad and actually stands up on it's own, but do be careful about spilling.  I will purchase it again.

By the end of the day I felt more talkative, confident, focused, and overall just better mentally and emotionally. My boyfriend took one who doesn't have bad anxiety and didn't notice a huge difference but felt slightly less stressed. For me the effects were similar to a cup of coffee, which I never drink because it doesn't react with my nerves well but the L-theanine didn't make me feel jittery. I actually had too much energy and I had trouble staying asleep. I've decided to break them in half and take 100mg a day for a little while first. Bottom line, I feel great already and I feel the L-theanine is going to make a huge difference in my mood, my personal life, and my demanding job.

Probably since 1995. I've probably spent over $1,000 or more on sleep supplement's and none work.  I will not let my Doctor know about the tolerance issue as she would put me on a SSRI which as a Clinical Psycologist know do more harm for sleep then good.
