The taste isn't quite as good as the Twisted variety by Premier which only has 15 grams of protein (and fewer calories) but it isn't bad at all. The bars aren't too sweet and don't taste \"fake\" or weird. The flavors are not my favorite. I prefer caramel and peanut butter bars (separately not together in one bar) but I really like getting 30 grams of protein in because my diet is always lacking enough protein. I eat one for breakfast and I don't even get hungry until well past lunch time.

It is nice to have a choice to satisfy a sweet tooth or a craving for a savory treat. The barbecue style flavor definitely satisfies my craving for savory. Plus, KIND bars are hearty. They fill me up and are great when we are out and active. When on a road trip, eating a granola bar enables us to skip a meal and continue driving. It is hard to find a quick meal out on the road, especially when we do not eat fast food. These bars have saved the day many times.

My husband is really picky about granola bars and was finally happy when we tried this flavor. For too long all we could find were sickeningly sweet bars of sugar, or worse, high fructose corn syrup. We could not find granola bars made out of quality ingredients. There are so many unique flavors in this line of granola bars, and the Hickory Smoke is a innovative one. Finally there is a granola bar without chocolate and sugar. I was going to describe it as savory, and then I realized it is part of the name. It really is a flavor that makes the bar more than just a snack. In this flavor there are 3 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein. There is also calcium, iron, and other nutrients. I can eat a bar and feel filled and energized. My husband and I take a variety of KIND bars with us when we go camping and on road trips. It is nice to have a choice to satisfy a sweet tooth or a craving for a savory treat. The barbecue style flavor definitely satisfies my craving for savory. Plus, KIND bars are hearty. They fill me up and are great when we are out and active. When on a road trip, eating a granola bar enables us to skip a meal and continue driving. It is hard to find a quick meal out on the road, especially when we do not eat fast food. These bars have saved the day many times. When we are camping, a delicious dose of salty and smokey flavor gives us staying power on long hikes. They are easy to carry in our backpacks. Each bar is 1.6 ounces of goodness, and the box comes with 12 bars that are packed with sustenance. I really like the KIND bar brand, especially the STRONG and KIND line.

I was afraid my bars would be dry like everyone else stated, but mine seemed to be the opposite. Everything in my box was oily. The outside of all the bars had some sort of moist, oily droplets on them, causing them to stick together, and each bar I ate (I still ate them all), when I opened them, were also unusually oily. This may have affected the quality of the bars because they weren't as good as I remember them from the gym. I recently ran out of these that I purchased online and went back to buying them from the gym, and they aren't oily like the one's I received, and they taste just like how I remember initially.

Some other reviewers has stated some bars are harder than others.  I have noticed that the softness does vary from box to box, but it is not a problem for me.  Each jar of almond butter I open has a different amount of oil separation in it and I think that is what is going on with these bars.  Some bars have more naturally occurring almond oil from the almonds and thus some bars are softer than others, but even the \"harder\" bars are still appetizing to me.  I do not get a blood sugar spike from these bars and they fill me up.

The outside of all the bars had some sort of moist, oily droplets on them, causing them to stick together, and each bar I ate (I still ate them all), when I opened them, were also unusually oily.

I recently ran out of these that I purchased online and went back to buying them from the gym, and they aren't oily like the one's I received, and they taste just like how I remember initially.

Some other reviewers has stated some bars are harder than others.  I have noticed that the softness does vary from box to box, but it is not a problem for me.  Each jar of almond butter I open has a different amount of oil separation in it and I think that is what is going on with these bars.

Love the macro ratio and I believe the Zone concept works.  I used to live on these bars (in a manner of speaking), especially strawberry yogurt, the best flavor in my opinion.  They are great in a pinch to curb hunger, keep in your purse or backpack.  That said, because of the high sugar content, they often made me crave more of them in a short amount of time and crave carbs in general.  So, despite the \"soy nuggets\" for protein, I was not fully satiated for more than an hour.  After several decades on the market, they still contain high amounts of sugars and questionable fats.

I happen to really like dark chocolate, and these give that good bittersweet dark chocolate taste that I love. There is also a thin layer of caramel that adds to the chew factor. The center is crunchy like packed chocolate rice krispies. The bar is a good size with, I'd say, about 10 bites per bar, which gives some good chew factor if you're dieting. (of course, those are normal bites, not hungry bites).  I take these to work with me because I rarely have time to sit down and eat. Sometimes I keep them in the freezer just for that added OOmphf when I dunk them in my coffee. There is only 1 gram of fiber which I'm sure my co-workers are thankful for, but there is 12 grams of protein and 160mg potassium -- good for muscles and electrolyte balance.

I could barely get passed eating a single bar, and I thought Quest Bars were bad since changing their ingredients list. The nutrition on these is pretty decent, but if you're looking for something actually tasty and not tasting like stale, gritty cardboard, maybe try the Musclepharm Combat Crunch in Birthday cake. It has a lemony hint to it. To be fair, they remind me slightly of fruit loops cereal. Not my favorite, but it's still WAY more tasty and the texture is awesome.

They have a very low sugar count.  Only 2 grams per bar, and yet seem much sweeter than the competitors.  I am very picky and have tried many brands of protein bars.  There is quite a high vitamin count and 20g of protein. I have seen bars with higher vitamin/mineral percentages, but they tend to be for weight gain or body building.  I use them as meal substitutes or high protein snacks.  Now for the 3 flavors..... No brand seems to pull of CHOCOLATE very well, and this brand is no different, but these are better than most.  So if you love chocolate and want low sugar, this is the best I've found.  CHEWY Chocolate Chip.... AMAZING.  Not like the crappy chewy granola bars.  I don't think it is very much chewier than their normal bars, just slightly.  But the taste is awesome.  It's like raw cookie dough flavor.  I was pleasantly surprised with this flavor and it is now a favorite.  Tastes sinful, and I don't know how they pull it off with such great nutrition numbers.  Chocolate PEANUT BUTTER.... This flavor is really peanut buttery,  Coated in chocolate but has the flavor of a peanut butter cookie with a swirl of real peanut butter inside.  Again.... Another great flavor.  Very impressed.  In summary, the chocolate is not bad (better than most, so no removal of a star), but the exceptional flavors of the other 2 are TOP NOTCH.

Like one amazon reviewer before said that the Chocolate Deluxe was average, he or she was right.  Chocolate Peanut Butter and Chewy Chocolate Chip were much taster.  I would give Peanut Butter an A and Chewy Choco a B and Choco Deluxe a C in the taste department.  Once again you can never go wrong with any of these bars!

These bars are delicious and very low in sugar!  I can say that these will replace your desert cravings.  Are you not you when your hungry?  Grab a snicker?  Nope, I'm grabbing this.

You might even get gassy downstairs.  Also it may act as a laxative.  I suggest only eating one of these.  As for the taste I give it a B+ overall.  Like one amazon reviewer before said that the Chocolate Deluxe was average, he or she was right.  Chocolate Peanut Butter and Chewy Chocolate Chip were much taster.  I would give Peanut Butter an A and Chewy Choco a B and Choco Deluxe a C in the taste department.  Once again you can never go wrong with any of these bars!

I bought the box of these based on the touted consistency being akin to a soft baked cookie, which I did not find to be the case. They are less like taffy than some bars, but nothing like a soft cookie either. Most annoyingly, the chocolate outer coating is very prone to melting.
