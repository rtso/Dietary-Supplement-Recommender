First and foremost, I completely support other posters that claim \"it takes a while\" to notice improvement. My hotflashes were practically debilitating; around the clock, hourly and intense. It was tough to keep the faith and press-on without immediate relief. I highly recommend sticking with it! It took about 2 weeks of 3 capsules per day. Admittedly, I did experience some constipation at first, and used a gentle softener to counteract that side effect.  As of week 3, I was able to reducemy intake to 2 capsules daily, which has eliminated that one side-effect. Now, in week 4, I am taking 2 capsules daily with breakfast, and hotflashes are almost completely gone. I do have an occasional break-through flash, but they're less than one or two per week!

So I decided after my mom has told me for YEARS to try evening primpose oil, at the end of my rope with my symptoms and not wanting to do any kind of prescription  hormones I said to myself I was just gonna take it and see what happens. I did some research and and figured out what level of GLA I should be looking for and read LOTS of reviews and purchases this product. I take 4 pills a day and that amount is working amazingly. 2 period cycles later it's a whole different ball game.  My boyfriend can't even tell when I'm about to start my period anymore, and frankly before, each month we were on the verge of breaking up sometimes because I would act like a crazy person, and he could tell as soon as my pms started. No more cramps, my periods are lighter and shorter and generally much more pleasant then the horrific emotional bloodbath I had become accustomed to. And the best part of all of this, the wonderful  little side effect I had thought wouldnt work for me, is my acne I've struggled with my entire life (I'm in my 30's) has cleared up significantly.  Does my skin look like a magazine model? No. But, is it 95% better? Yes!!! I hardly wear any foundation or concealer anymore and I've had 4-5 very small pimples in the last 2 months which is basically nothing for me, which has been so amazing. I used to wear A LOT of makeup to cover up my acne which we all know just makes it look worse.
