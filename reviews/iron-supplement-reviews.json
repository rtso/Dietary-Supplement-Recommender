My doc wanted to know what I was doing differently and I handed him a copy of the label of Blood Builder so that he can pass this information along to his other anemic patients.

I switched to these as they are a reputable natural brand & are highly reviewed. I want to love them, but unfortunately they have caused stomach issues & binding up, which has been my biggest issue with every other iron pill except Hema-Plex. I've been avoiding taking these pills to avoid the side effects, and unfortunately I'm also feeling the side effects of not taking iron supplements.

No bathroom issues whatsoever and you can even take it on an empty stomach! This past week I had my blood checked again and my iron level is 40! within range and no longer severely anemic! My CBC + Platelet numbers have all increased as well, since my last testing in March, to either within range or just right beneath the low end of the normal ranges. This supplement is a godsend!

A year later, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. My iron was low for years but my doctor never made a big deal about it. After taking Lyrica and gaining 50 lbs, I went to a new rheumatologist. My iron level was 3 and my red blood count was so low that he compared it to having just given 2 pints of blood. My resting heart rate was 120-130, I was exhausted and out of breath with the slightest exertion. He sent me to a hematologist and I had 5 weeks of IV iron infusion. Following that, my iron level was 175 and my red blood count was normal. Additonally, my pain was GONE. My cats could walk on me without me screaming. I could run up and down the stairs and not get winded. I felt normal for the first time in 10 years. One month later, my iron was back down to 5 and the pain was back. The rheumatologist said that he has a statistically abnormal number of patients with fibro who have had gastric bypass. He believes that the trauma of the bypass triggers fibro. Additionally, there are fibro studies that directly link pain with iron deficiency. I was excited and ready to get regular IV iron to keep my level high. Unfortunately, you can't get approved for IV iron unless you are anemic. I had tried prescription iron supplements a few times but could not stomach them. I was resigned to the fact that if I wanted to feel good, I would have to deal with the stomach issues and take the supplements. I started googling to find other bypass or fibro people to see what kind of iron they took and I found Blood Builder. I take 3 a day, usually after lunch and never have any problems with an upset stomach. My iron has been building up steadily, so I am hopeful that I will reach a level where the pain goes away again. My rheumatologist was so impressed with it that he has suggested it to other patients - and he is not a supplement kind of guy. Additionally, I have started losing weight without changing my eating habits and not exercising. I read somewhere that low iron affects all kinds of bodily functions, including metabolism. That's a happy side effect!  If you have had bypass surgery and/or you have fibromyalgia, I recommend you try this for a few months.

I couldn't believe it.  It did not only normalize my hemoglobin levels, but after a couple more months, all my blood levels were perfect.

My first hematologist had me take these iron supplements (ferrous sulfate) that actually messed up my digestive system and made me severely ill (I think they caused gastro-intestinal bleeding), which is why I kept needing blood transfusions.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone having any kind of blood issues.  Another hematologist told me straight out that these supplements wouldn't help me because they don't contain enough iron to bring my levels up, but he was wrong!

A year later, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. My iron was low for years but my doctor never made a big deal about it. After taking Lyrica and gaining 50 lbs, I went to a new rheumatologist. My iron level was 3 and my red blood count was so low that he compared it to having just given 2 pints of blood. My resting heart rate was 120-130, I was exhausted and out of breath with the slightest exertion. He sent me to a hematologist and I had 5 weeks of IV iron infusion. Following that, my iron level was 175 and my red blood count was normal. Additonally, my pain was GONE. My cats could walk on me without me screaming. I could run up and down the stairs and not get winded. I felt normal for the first time in 10 years. One month later, my iron was back down to 5 and the pain was back. The rheumatologist said that he has a statistically abnormal number of patients with fibro who have had gastric bypass. He believes that the trauma of the bypass triggers fibro. Additionally, there are fibro studies that directly link pain with iron deficiency. I was excited and ready to get regular IV iron to keep my level high. Unfortunately, you can't get approved for IV iron unless you are anemic. I had tried prescription iron supplements a few times but could not stomach them. I was resigned to the fact that if I wanted to feel good, I would have to deal with the stomach issues and take the supplements. I started googling to find other bypass or fibro people to see what kind of iron they took and I found Blood Builder. I take 3 a day, usually after lunch and never have any problems with an upset stomach. My iron has been building up steadily, so I am hopeful that I will reach a level where the pain goes away again. My rheumatologist was so impressed with it that he has suggested it to other patients - and he is not a supplement kind of guy. Additionally, I have started losing weight without changing my eating habits and not exercising. I read somewhere that low iron affects all kinds of bodily functions, including metabolism. That's a happy side effect!  If you have had bypass surgery and/or you have fibromyalgia, I recommend you try this for a few months.

I was ready to just tough it out and keep going until my hubby got me some cheap generic type 65mg Ferrous Sulfate & I took it with OJ, Ester-C tablets & sublingual B12 all at the same time on an empty stomach.  That did the trick for me.  I'm sure everyone is different.  I think this is a good product especially for those who are experiencing mild to moderate iron absorption problems or lacking iron in the diet.  I totally agree 100% with it's statements about vitamin C and B being the key to iron absorption, but it also takes enzymes for that important reaction to take place so look into the whole process of how iron is taken up into the body.  That will help you sort out where you're going wrong or where you have digestive damage that won't allow uptake properly so you have to work hard at getting it in you.  I'd still recommend this for most people... just not those of us with long term digestive diseases that give us severe anemia issues.  I suggest taking it with a big meal though because those iron flavored acidic reflux burps are nauseating if you took it on an empty stomach.

Had it for three weeks, took two z-packs -still had it.  Went back in, got a steroid shot and an antibiotic shot  and requested for once in my life- blood work.  (needle phobia)  So, the next day my blood test comes back and I have severe anemia and need a transfusion.  But,  I feel better and emphatically do not want to have a transfusion.  I'm told to take an iron supplement for a month and then have more blood tests.  At this time, I am experiencing rapid heart rate which I attributed to anxiety from stress, sore throat, which was probably the glossitis from anemia, rabid ice eating (which I've done for years) a crack in the corner of my lip which I thought was just dehydration, low energy levels, lack of mental clarity which I attributed to regular fatigue, breakthrough bleeding and thinning hair.  So, I had a lot of symptoms. I think I've had severe anemia for many years but my body adjusted itself until it couldn't anymore.  About the only thing left was for me to get dizzy enough to faint.  I started two hours later on the otc iron by spring valley from wal-mart.- ferrous sulfate.  That night researched and found out about taking the pills on empty stomach with orange juice or vitamin c to increase acidity which increases absorption.  No eating two hours before or after.  No milk, no caffeine, all the myriad things that block iron absorption.  I ordered this product and didn't get it for a few days but added it to my schedule immediately.  I really didn't want a transfusion! .  Took two of these and two of the spring valley, spread out through the day.  Had to wake up in the middle of the night to do this.  Trying to wrap this up, not sure which worked?  I also ate only beef twice a day with orange juice or tomatoes for citrus. I never ate that much red meat in my life, btw, and also btw last year I lost 30 lbs. eating mostly fruit smoothies and nuts. Also, my b-12 levels about half of the normal level. My mother has anemia also (who knew?) and I think my condition is hereditary and dietary. The point is...all the reviews I could find said three weeks to increase your hemoglobin levels.  I did 2.5 points it in 10 days. (I know you can overdose on iron) My LPN's supervisor, a general practioner contacted me and insisted I come in.  Said he would give me two weeks to have more bloodwork done. But when he discussed my case with whomever, they all said  blood transfusion immediately.  I compromised and got the one week grace period.  By then I had been on iron 3 days or so. I now own just about every iron supplement available and will update as I find out more.  Just so you know, there is a supplement called Proferrin ES (got it on Amazon for $50.)that is based on heme(meat-based) iron that I just received and will be trying. And I'm taking B12 sublingually and getting a B-12 shot. I spent a lot of money on these supplements and it was freaking worth it to me to not have a transfusion.  Guess I'll be getting regular blood work now, great.  Once I'm out of dangerous levels, will experiment with what works best.  Now, daily I'm taking one Blood Builder with food, one proferrin ES with o.j.,and one ferrous sulfate with o.j.  Also adding ferrous fumarate from a prescription- swapping out every other day with the ferrous sulfate.  Still need to double my iron levels, and they took a lot of my precious new blood for the blood test! I mean really.  I'm getting tests done because of my blood problem! That was the closest I felt to dizzy through the whole ordeal.  Already staying up til 10:30 at night now, used to go to bed at 8PM. Concerned having anemia so long may have done permanent damage to my heart though. Doctor said not to exercise until I get my levels up, I could have cardiac arrest.***Update*** Doctor called with 3rd blood test results, taken May 21st. (First was done on April 25th.) Hemoglobin count at 11. Ran two miles and played softball this week.  Huge difference. First bill came in, from hospital lab for blood work.  Insurance paid $8 of a $250 bill. wow! That stings.

When I was younger iron supplements caused me no problems, but since I've gotten older they wreak havoc on my stomach.  And now that I am going through pre-menopausal symptoms with severe blood loss, I am not able to do without taking iron supplements.  I had gotten to the point of collapse from the slow process of iron reduction in my blood from my monthly cycles.  At which point, I got on line and searched for an iron product that would not tear my stomach apart.  I came across MegaFood Blood Builder which is produced from beet root.  The information that I read indicated that it was gentle on the stomach.  So, I gave it a shot, thinking that I would suffer, at least, a little bit of stomach discomfort, and I ordered it.  I was surprised when I began taking the pills and did not feel any adverse reactions in my stomach, but thought that after it builds up in my gut, I would begin to feel pain; but that never happened.  I have been taking this product for nearly a year and a half.  Because of the severity of my anemia I take more than the recommended dosage, according to the level of fatigue and blood loss I am experiencing at the time; and have never felt any inkling of stomach irritation.  I believe this product has saved me from becoming hospitalized and having to undergo the surgical alteration/removal of my female organ.

I took it exactly as specified & got mild relief of the symptoms... I was sleeping about 12 to 15 hours a day but able to stay awake the other hours and function.  But the downside was that this stuff was harsh on my stomach with iron taste and smell and burps & reflux from hell no matter what I did.  I was ready to just tough it out and keep going until my hubby got me some cheap generic type 65mg Ferrous Sulfate & I took it with OJ, Ester-C tablets & sublingual B12 all at the same time on an empty stomach.  That did the trick for me.  I'm sure everyone is different.  I think this is a good product especially for those who are experiencing mild to moderate iron absorption problems or lacking iron in the diet.  I totally agree 100% with it's statements about vitamin C and B being the key to iron absorption, but it also takes enzymes for that important reaction to take place so look into the whole process of how iron is taken up into the body.  That will help you sort out where you're going wrong or where you have digestive damage that won't allow uptake properly so you have to work hard at getting it in you.  I'd still recommend this for most people... just not those of us with long term digestive diseases that give us severe anemia issues.  I suggest taking it with a big meal though because those iron flavored acidic reflux burps are nauseating if you took it on an empty stomach.

When I read the reviews, they were so great, I just had to try it, as my anemia was not getting better following my hematologist's suggestions/orders.  After only one month, taking one a day, it raised my hemoglobin up to 13.0 - the highest it has ever been (it's funny because I read a review and the reviewer said it brought their hemoglobin up to 13 as well).  I couldn't believe it.  It did not only normalize my hemoglobin levels, but after a couple more months, all my blood levels were perfect.  Even my new hematologist told me that he wished his blood levels were as good as mine!  I think this is really like some miracle supplement!  The best part about it is that is from all whole foods.  My first hematologist had me take these iron supplements (ferrous sulfate) that actually messed up my digestive system and made me severely ill (I think they caused gastro-intestinal bleeding), which is why I kept needing blood transfusions.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone having any kind of blood issues.  Another hematologist told me straight out that these supplements wouldn't help me because they don't contain enough iron to bring my levels up, but he was wrong!

Had it for three weeks, took two z-packs -still had it.  Went back in, got a steroid shot and an antibiotic shot  and requested for once in my life- blood work.  (needle phobia)  So, the next day my blood test comes back and I have severe anemia and need a transfusion.  But,  I feel better and emphatically do not want to have a transfusion.  I'm told to take an iron supplement for a month and then have more blood tests.  At this time, I am experiencing rapid heart rate which I attributed to anxiety from stress, sore throat, which was probably the glossitis from anemia, rabid ice eating (which I've done for years) a crack in the corner of my lip which I thought was just dehydration, low energy levels, lack of mental clarity which I attributed to regular fatigue, breakthrough bleeding and thinning hair.  So, I had a lot of symptoms. I think I've had severe anemia for many years but my body adjusted itself until it couldn't anymore.  About the only thing left was for me to get dizzy enough to faint.  I started two hours later on the otc iron by spring valley from wal-mart.- ferrous sulfate.  That night researched and found out about taking the pills on empty stomach with orange juice or vitamin c to increase acidity which increases absorption.  No eating two hours before or after.  No milk, no caffeine, all the myriad things that block iron absorption.  I ordered this product and didn't get it for a few days but added it to my schedule immediately.  I really didn't want a transfusion! .  Took two of these and two of the spring valley, spread out through the day.  Had to wake up in the middle of the night to do this.  Trying to wrap this up, not sure which worked?  I also ate only beef twice a day with orange juice or tomatoes for citrus. I never ate that much red meat in my life, btw, and also btw last year I lost 30 lbs. eating mostly fruit smoothies and nuts. Also, my b-12 levels about half of the normal level. My mother has anemia also (who knew?) and I think my condition is hereditary and dietary. The point is...all the reviews I could find said three weeks to increase your hemoglobin levels.  I did 2.5 points it in 10 days. (I know you can overdose on iron) My LPN's supervisor, a general practioner contacted me and insisted I come in.  Said he would give me two weeks to have more bloodwork done. But when he discussed my case with whomever, they all said  blood transfusion immediately.  I compromised and got the one week grace period.  By then I had been on iron 3 days or so. I now own just about every iron supplement available and will update as I find out more.  Just so you know, there is a supplement called Proferrin ES (got it on Amazon for $50.)that is based on heme(meat-based) iron that I just received and will be trying. And I'm taking B12 sublingually and getting a B-12 shot. I spent a lot of money on these supplements and it was freaking worth it to me to not have a transfusion.  Guess I'll be getting regular blood work now, great.  Once I'm out of dangerous levels, will experiment with what works best.  Now, daily I'm taking one Blood Builder with food, one proferrin ES with o.j.,and one ferrous sulfate with o.j.  Also adding ferrous fumarate from a prescription- swapping out every other day with the ferrous sulfate.  Still need to double my iron levels, and they took a lot of my precious new blood for the blood test! I mean really.  I'm getting tests done because of my blood problem! That was the closest I felt to dizzy through the whole ordeal.  Already staying up til 10:30 at night now, used to go to bed at 8PM. Concerned having anemia so long may have done permanent damage to my heart though. Doctor said not to exercise until I get my levels up, I could have cardiac arrest.***Update*** Doctor called with 3rd blood test results, taken May 21st. (First was done on April 25th.) Hemoglobin count at 11. Ran two miles and played softball this week.  Huge difference. First bill came in, from hospital lab for blood work.  Insurance paid $8 of a $250 bill. wow! That stings.

It is not a hard, compact, pill. It is like a standard vegetarian capsule where it is a greenish powder contained in a single capsule. The dosage states only one capsule is needed (which is great because I hate taking pills!). It is a good size and super easy to swallow. I take this in the evening around an hour before bedtime. I have read it is better to take iron supplements after all of your meals are complete. Overall I am pleased with this product. I have had no upset tummy or constipation side effects from taking this. I am still waiting to see how the supplement impacts my overall RLS symptoms since I've only been taking a week.

So this will prevent iron deficiency anemia and megaloblastic anemia (caused by B12 and/or folate deficiency). The L-Histidine is an essential amino acid (meaning our bodies cannot make it on its own, we have to get it from an outside source) that is also part of the same process of folate and b12.

I initially opposed taking supplements as everything I saw online about which supplement, when and with what was a bit overwhelming. But it came down to having to take them. A coworker actually recommended this one as her high school age daughter takes these. Glad I took her advice as so far so good. I personally have had no stomach issues with these.

Some believe they are caused by a virus (but not related to the herpes viruses--I know--I have oral herpes and the two are quite different), and there does seem to be a genetic component in that many people with these sores state other family members also have them (NHS data). I've tried many things to deal with this issue, including lysine (a careful six-month trial with no change) and various OTC salves, rinses, and mouthwashes, including saline. Nothing seems to change the frequency of the \"attacks,\" and the OTC treatments basically treat the symptoms, not the underlying cause(s). My adult daughter began taking Rainbow Light's prenatal vitamins a few years ago before the birth of her second child. She has also suffered from mouth ulcers since childhood. When she told me she had not had any mouth ulcers since beginnning the vitamins, I compared the ingredients of the prenatal vitamin with Rainbow Light's other vitamin/mineral supplements. I also checked on the web for any new information and learned that some people's issues might rest in a B12 or Iron deficiency. I already take B12 (injections), and I am anemic from time to time, so I thought an iron deficiency might be part of my problem. I began taking Rainbow Light's Adult Active vitamins and added Complete Iron mini-tabs. I began this regimen in July of 2015, a  month after a very bad attack of mouth ulcers following an unidentified virus in June that had me in the ER during a vacation. Since that time, I have had a few mouth ulcers, just a few, and the ulcers I have had have been much smaller, less painful, and healed more quickly than in the past. Usually, I would get at least two or three small ones once or twice a month (not with a menses period; I am post-menopausal), and a more severe attack (more ulcers and much larger, making it difficult to eat). It's also worth mentioning that I have taken iron in the past to help with occasional anemia, but the iron tablets always upset my stomach, even when I took them with food. I have not had a single problem with the Complete Iron tablets, not even when I've taken the tablet with the RL multi-vitamin without food. I highly recommend these tablets if you need iron.

After getting a full panel of blood work done and having it indicate that I almost had no iron in my body, I spoke to my my brother (who is a health enthusiast) and he told me to look into the issue of thinning hair and low iron in women. Low and behold, I found a lot of information about women's thinning hair issues and having low iron without anemia. I went back to the endocronolgist armed with my research and she too confirmed that having such low iron could be contributing to my issue so she prescribed me 325mg of ferrous sulfate (which equals 130mg of elemental iron). This dosage is 600% more than the daily recommended iron dose for women! Yes,  my iron was that low... As i looked back over previous blood test from my annual physical exams, apparently it had been like that for years, but because the ferritin level was at the very bottom end of the very wide range or big gap of what is considered normal, my Dr didn't bother to mention any concern for the issue. This is why, to some degree, I've learned that you really have to take your healthcare in your own hands. Anyhow, after just taking  the prescription drugs for 2 or 3 days, my stomach was in so much pain that I had to leave work a few times. The prescription drugs also causes you to be very constipated. The endocrinologist told me that I would have to take those pills about a year to get my iron and ferritin levels up to par, but I knew there was no way in hell I was going to suffer taking those pills for a whole year because they debilated my quality of life just that much. So, I started looking for alternatives immediately and I came across these pills. I began taking them about 30 days before my next blood test and as I took them, I had no stomach cramping, no feeling of nausea and best of all, I wasn't constipated at all. However, you must have something on your stomach before taking them because they can make your stomach upset a little if it's empty. To put this review in perspetive, in Aug 2013 before taking these pills my ferrition was 11.6 on a scale of 11.0-307 and my iron was 27 on a scale of 50-212. When I went back in about 30 days to have my blood re-tested my ferritin had increased to 17 and my iron had increased to 142! That was amazing to me! Research says that you need to get ferritin levels up to at least 70 for several months before any significant change with hair can be seen, but I will say that just taking these pills alone (2 pills 2x per day) definitely was a big help! However, because I needed way more iron to build of my iron stores (i.e. ferritin, since it's the hardest to build up)  and I didn't want to pop these pills all day long, I now take these along wth Ferrett's Iron Supplement because you get 106 elemetal iron in one pill with the Ferret's brand iron. In early Oct 2013, I began taking 2 of the Now iron pills first thing in the morning with a tangerine (Vitamin C helps increase absoption) and 2 hours before having any dairy (dairy decreases iron absorbtion). And at night, I take 1 Ferretts Iron Supplement pill and one 1000mg of Vitamin C tablet before I go to bed and I am delighted to report that my 3rd  blood test that I took on Nov 6, 2013 revealed that my iron level is now 168 and my ferritin is 49.9. I am very glad that I choose the natural alterntative to increase my iron levels and if you try either of these two products, you will be glad too!
