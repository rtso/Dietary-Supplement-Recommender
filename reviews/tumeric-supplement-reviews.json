I take two per day as a standard dosage and when I am experiencing more pain I take four.  The only side effect I experienced when taking higher doses combined with Advil is that I had blood in my stools the next day.  Turmeric is one of the most important herbs for us to take and even though I took it initially for anti-inflammation, the more I read about the herb the more I became interested in the numerous benefits namely the detoxification effect and its ability to help cleanse the liver.  One positive effect I notice but haven't read much about is the effect it has on my sinus and lung congestion.  Lumen Naturals has a very thoughtful and supportive team who address concerns and questions that you might have.  I like the convenience of capsule forms of supplements, yet I am drawn more to bulk powders and high potency curcumin extracts that I can make tinctures out of.  I believe buying the powders is a more cost effective way at supplementing with Turmeric and capsules.", "rating": "5"}, {"helpful": 0, "title": "I'm a Believer!", "body": "I have been truly impressed with this product.

My pain levels have dramatically decreased and I'm able to function on a normal basis. Also, I've tried a variety of other brands of turmeric, but the Schwartz brand works far more effective in comparison.

Also, diabetics on medications, curcumin can cause low blood sugar.  Also, could be a problem with interference with drugs for acid reflux.  This info is from various websites. Bottom line, check with your doctor if you are on any medications.  My sister's nurse recommended it to my sister, but she overlooked that my sister was on blood thinners.

I've been able to increase my physical activity without needing something else which I think is great given what I've been through and how I'm pushing physically. The other day I biked for 35 miles on trails and was good. What to me is even more impressive was the 1.25 mile jog (no stopping) that I did.

I love this turmeric.", "body": "I have been using this turmeric since August 30, 2016. My wrist and knee have arthritis and get inflamed and painful. This turmeric takes away the pain and the inflammation. However, the real reason I would absolutely recommend this supplement is because of the effect it has had on my dog. I have a Labradoodle, he is a puppy mill rescue, so he has health issues. He is only 8 years old but some days he would put weight on his front paw and scream with pain. I already have him on 1300mg of fish oil 2x a day and chondroitin/glucosamine/msm. It looked like I would have to put him to sleep because of the pain of the arthritis. His hips are horrible too, if he walked around too much, the next day he could hardly move. As a last ditch effort I decided to try giving him turmeric. The benefits of turmeric are well documented. I started giving him turmeric on 8/30/16. One pill 2x a day. It has been nothing short of a miracle. This dog will now bring me his Kong to throw for him, he runs and jumps and can even get up on the bed again. I really missed having him to snuggle at night. He NEVER screams in pain and his hips don't look like he is in pain as he moves around. I love this stuff. I had already purchased another bottle, when they sent me one for free (I love that they send you a free bottle). I will be ordering this turmeric forever. I have another dog, he is10 years old and was walking like his bones were broken, he would fall down the stairs when I took him out and then he would fall on the stairs as we came back in. He would also just be walking in the house and fall over. I was sure that by winter I would lose both of these dogs due to the pain. I started giving him one pill 2x a day at the same time that me and the other dog started taking it. And this turmeric has had the same effect on him that it did on my other dog. He walks around easily now and doesn't fall on the steps or anywhere else. These dogs have had these problems for a while, so for this turmeric to help them so fast was just amazing. They have no problem taking it. I recommend trying it if you or your dog has pain and inflammation of any sort. I love that something so inexpensive and readily available helped me and my dogs.

I've been taking Tumeric Curcumin for the last year or so but feel that Schwartz's product is far superior to any other companies supplement. The Bioperine is extracted from black pepper because research has shown that taking it with Tumeric Curcumin helps make it more bioavailable, something I hadn't known until I saw it on their product literature and then did some further independent research that confirmed it. Tumeric Curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory compound that also is an antioxidant that helps our immune systems fight pathogens, and helps reduce chronic inflammation at the cellular level, which is believed to be a major cause of most chronic disease conditions. It also has positive influence on the growth of new neurons and helps the body increase levels of BDNF, a type of growth hormone that helps brain function. Their is reason to believe that it can help prevent or treat cancer, heart disease, and due to it's ability to cross the brain-blood barrier there's reason to hope it can help prevent Alzheimer's disease. Schwartz's Tumeric has the recommended 95% standardized Curcuminoids level and a large enough dose to supply the body with this poorly absorbed compound, which is enhanced by the addition of the Bioperine as mentioned earlier.

He/she said that while taking turmeric curcumin nose bleeding was experienced, as he/she found out the hard way about this drug interaction, since this person was on blood thinners. Also, diabetics on medications, curcumin can cause low blood sugar.  Also, could be a problem with interference with drugs for acid reflux.  This info is from various websites. Bottom line, check with your doctor if you are on any medications.  My sister's nurse recommended it to my sister, but she overlooked that my sister was on blood thinners.

What a product.  I have arthritis in my knee that is in continuous pain due to swelling and will have to have a knee replacement one of these days but the longer I get around without swelling pain the longer I can postpone surgery.  I take Meloxicam to ease the swelling and still had to take Tylenol to get through my day.  I have been taking 3 capsules of this product every morning for 3 weeks and my knee pain is totally gone. I don't have to take Tylenol 3 times a day and have gotten off of the Meloxicam. My knee if still a little stiff in the mornings but after my exercises I am off and running. I also have arthritis in my hips and the pain is totally gone.  I am a BIG Natural Supplement Cure SCEPTIC and usually regard these types of supplements as Snake Oil but I will definitely keep taking this supplement.", "rating": "5"}, {"helpful": 0, "title": "My husband and I have been taking 2 capsules daily for about 3 weeks now and I can honestly say that we are feeling much better.", "body": "My husband and I both have issues with back pain and we had been taking Ibuprofen for the pain.

I knew that Purity Labs is a reputable company and when I saw that it was an organic product it sealed the deal for me. My husband and I have been taking 2 capsules daily for about 3 weeks now and I can honestly say that we are feeling much better. I am off the Ibuprofen and my husband is taking much less of it and I'm assuming in time he will be able to completely off of it. I also have to say that the company has been a pleasure to work with. I received the capsules when promised and the follow up from the representative was amazing!

You could no longer read his handwriting, and he'd spill his coffee when trying to put the cup to his mouth.  When the shaky hands started for me, I was concerned, but did not want to take medication.  I started on turmeric for joint pain, which it has helped.  But the bonus is that my hands are steady, and you can read my writing again.

Note that the bottle contains 120 capsules, and that a dose is two capsules, so there are 60 servings per bottle. Of greater concern is that the bottle advertises \"Contains pure Turmeric standardized to 95% Curcumin\" on the front of the bottle, and indeed that is true, however a careful reading of the back of the bottle reveals that 100 mg/dose is standardized to 95% curcumin out of a dose of 900 mg.
