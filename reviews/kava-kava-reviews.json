I have to update because I have bought 8 bottles since this report and nothing has happened like the first absolutely mind altering experience that I had with first time. I have to say that I took such high dosages each time because of severe chronic pain issue. I don't know what to do with the last 50 capsules of this seventh bottle because I lowered my dosage from 60 capsules at once to this bottle at 10 capsules at once. Very slight relaxation if any, but strong diuretic effects. If you have level 9 pain I would say take a whole bottle, but I don't recommend this to anyone else because you won't sleep because to much dopamine is being released and you will probably puke your guts out. I get little upset stomach so I can do this. You will be urinating all night also. Not much fun for most people. My blood tests have been normal.

Most impressive is the fact that I was able to write a fairly complicated computer program without once getting stressed out and without making any silly mistakes in the code (I always make mistakes, so this was fairly remarkable).

I've tried various powders and capsules over the years and they were utter nonsense compared to authentic fresh kava.  Never could afford having the frozen fresh stuff shipped over, which can cost 200+ a kilo, but started looking again recently. Decided to go ahead and give Wakacon a try after reading some reviews here and got this stuff in today. Mixed up 4oz(1 1/3 cups) to 48oz of water and coconut water mixed. After the 3rd glass, ALAS!! That warm peaceful glow that only \"Liquid Aloha\" knows. It's been 12 years or so sense I've last had that kava feeling and am profoundly grateful that this brand actually works. I might have mixed it up strong compared to some of the other methods I've seen but after so many years of disappointment I wanted to make sure it was STRONG. I can't really say this batch was strong compared to the stuff I used to make but it works. I warmed up the coconut water and added it and the kava to a blender to blend for a bit. Then, poured that into a kava cheesecloth I've had for years. Took a while for it to strain through the cheesecloth. I decided to knead it instead through about 12oz of water which helped work all that fine particulate out of the cheesecloth. Poured that stuff in with the rest, and wa la, we have kava. This stuff tasted more \"peppery\" than \"numbing\" than what I remember, but after the 3rd 12oz serving of 4, I had to jump on here to let you guys know this stuff is legit. The 4th cup may be overdoing it as I can feel this stuff is actually somewhat strong now after starting to type this. I was going to just give it 4 stars because it isn't the fresh stuff, but starting to feel it's effects more pronounced and reminding me of what I have missed for all these years, Wakacon Kava gets 5 stars.

I heard really great things about this and finally made the plunge to order after seeing it featured on the show Booze Traveler. I looked up youtube videos on how to take it properly and yadda yadda. A lot of websites and videos made it seem like this stuff was potent and to start with a teaspoon and all kinds of other passive aggressive 'careful how you do this to see how it affects you' jargon. Then upon watching videos, people that visited native countries of this drink were downing bowl after bowl in one first time sitting... so I was conflicted. Tried a heaping teaspoon mixed in like 4oz water. Tongue was a little numb for a couple minutes, nothing noteworthy other than that. I stared into space maybe 13% more than usual, but how I felt was not different (did this with a friend, we had the same experience). I let that sit for an hour with no noteworthy side effects, then said eff it and made a small pitcher and we sipped quite a bit and made it pretty potent. Still didn't do a whole lot. I don't do drugs and have never actually even smoked a cigarette or weed. Occasional couple glasses of wine is all I get down with so I thought that it would be easy for me to identify how this affects my body. Nope. I had higher expectations for this since I visited the Dominican Republic and definitely got a unique experience drinking their native root mix 'mamajuana' so I had assumed this root mixture would have similar properties,despite being a different root I know.... I at least knew it was possible to get a buzz from roots lol... or do something besides numb my tongue for a minute. The crappy part is that studies show kava shouldn't be mixed with alcohol in the same sitting because of how it can affect your kidneys... considering what I was expecting from this stuff and didn't get, I really wanted to just drink instead. I realize nothing would (or did, I caved after being so disappointed expecting a good time) happen from drinking them both in one single night... but still. If you're looking for a euphoric experience, you'll sooner get it from a sugar rush. Just take a shot of rum or something. Or try to get your hands on some authentic mamajuana from the DR. I'll try to finish this giant bag eventually and hope I experience something different.

Take two heaping tablespoons of the kava powder and put it into the strainer bag (which you should purchase with this Kava)(For two or more people just increase the recipe in the same order (4 heaping teaspoons and 16oz of water etc)).  Then get a nice big deep bowl and pour 8oz of SLIGHTLY WARM (cannot be hot) water into the bowl, then close the strainer bag with you hand and dunk the kava powder into the bowl.  Then for the next 10 minutes VIGOROUSLY squeeze the bag as hard as you can over and over, mushing the stuff around in the bag.  You arm will be tired after doing this for 10 minutes but its all part of the lovely process of Kava.

The effects from the kavalactones in the kava is what produces this feeling. Although my mind is clear and \"sober\", my body feels very relaxed. It is a great alternative to sleeping supplements or drugs as it helps you fall asleep afterwards, and you actually get quality sleep compared to supplements, drugs, or even alcohol (so don't drive after drinking Kava, you might fall asleep!). There were times it made me feel spirituality connected to the Earth, other times I feel empathy. I was disappointed the first few weeks as I didn't feel anything most of the time. The whole \"reverse tolerance\" thing is somewhat true, it took me nearly a month until I started to get consistent positive effects from it. Also, adding milk or nutmilk really helps increase the effects, as well as spending a lot more time squeezing, kneading, and extracting the kavalactones from the kava. The only side effects are that you may feel cold and chilly temporarily during your kava sessions so wearing extra layers is a good idea. And you might feel sick to your stomach if you drink too much or make your kava too strong and also get a very slight hangover if you drink too much of it. This is a good brand.

As it does literally throughout the entire islands of the South Pacific, where Kava is grown for tribal and/or commercial use. Legend has it, that the \"Mother Root\" of the Kava plant has its origins in the island of Vanuatu. From there, cuttings were transported and took on their own certain properties, such as potency, and certain other characteristics of the prepared and processed dried root has... This can vary accordingly, on where and how it is grown, harvested and other aspects of preparation for consumption. Typically, the further southern regions are more potent. Not always of course, but it does seem to be true in my samplings in the last 15-20 years. Also by legend, Kava grown in Papua New Guinea is the most potent variety available... It is also equally scarce and difficult to obtain. Kava is also graded by certain standards. Waka grade Kava is usually a very fine grind, with few if any lateral root remnants in the final harvested process. Such is the case with Wakacon's High Quality Fijian Kava. This Kava from Fiji has a bit of a \"bite\" to it, which is a common characteristic with most Fijian Kava. It is also light in color... Kava grown in darker soil that is volcanic, will usually have a darker color during the preparation for consumption procedure. Lighter colored Kava does not indicate less potency. White Sands Kava from Tonga, is a good example of being both potent and high quality. This Waka Grade Fijian Kava is also easily prepared for blending instead of time consuming \"dunk and squeeze\", which can take 5-10 minutes or more, depending on the amount. Letting it soak in water, or coconut milk for about 30 minutes allows the kavalactones to permeate the liquid solution, and then blending on the high speed for about 30-60 seconds and strained through a medium meshed strainer is quite sufficient for use. Whether traditional, or conventional is up to the consumer. \"Mainlanders\" tend to be impatient, and traditional methods can be rough on the hands. The choice is up to the you.

Good luck finding that with other kava products without paying through the nose. I prepared this culling from my own techniques and  some of the good tips from other reviewers on this site. I blended 3 tablespoons w/1 cup coconut milk and 2 cups water for about 30 seconds w/my immersion blender. Then I let it sit for an hour. Next, I strained it through some ladies pantyhose and kneaded in a bowl for 5 minutes. Then it was ready to drink. I do microwave mine for about 30 seconds also. That seems to work well. Enjoy, this is a really good deal. I have ordered 3 other kava varieties including Wow!kava Wow!kava could be named not just for the strength but the price point, at 35 dollars for a half pound. It does knock you on your butt though for very little used. Another variety I tried, wasn't ground very much which the company maintained would preserve the kavalactones, but it lost a lot of potency with a standard preparation. I guess if you had a few virgins hanging around, willing to masticate the roots via chewing and spitting, that might work for you :) The other variety was from a herbalist and though the stuff was good, it made you feel slightly ill and like sleeping. Don't get me wrong, this stuff can make you feel a little sick too. Be sure to have water w/a little lemon on hand to sip on for the first hour. How to describe the feeling? I would say a dreamy, relaxed state and some slight euphoria. I only had a little though, not drinking the full preparation, but splitting it into two servings.

I did a lot of studying up on Kava Kava before I decided to purchase it, but one thing when purchasing is the fact you need a special strainer bag, and how to \"wash\" the product to create the drink, how many times you can wash it, and the ratio of Kava to water. My product is already gone,  basically waisted because on the first attempt, I mixed it and and tried filtering it through a micro mesh, but a lot of the pulp cane through, after about 6 cups I began to feel very sick and basically had to regurgitate everything, i did begin to feel the effects slightly but getting sick completely ruined everything. Then the next day after watching some videos of preparing with a strainer bag, I saw what the water should look like, but I was also using almost 1 cup of Kava to 2 cups water, not rewashing, and then filling with another cup of kava, I used the rest of the bag trying to prepare enough that I could drink how it was recommended online about a shell or bowl every 15-20 minutes. I still didn't have the special strainer bag. So I bought some cheese cloth, it worked better, but I did not make enough to get the full benefit, but again afterwards i went back online, read about the multiple washes, using more water, however I had no more product to try it proper. Instructions and or items needed to prepare it should be listed on the product so that you can see it when your purchasing. I feel like I waisted my money, so probably won't purchase again unless I get the other items I need to prepare it correctly. I still really don't know how to prepare it ratio wise, I don't know how many cups you should drink, how many ounces is a cup,shell, or bowl? Are the special bags reusable,  how many times can you wash. I already waisted almost  $40 I would be a fool to buy it again until I have everything I need, so in short I'm very unhappy with the purchase, even a packet of koolaid has instructions and ratios."}, {"helpful": 1, "title": "not strong enough, need to learn how?", "rating": "4", "body": "Not as strong as I'd like."}, {"helpful": 2, "title": "Kava Waka is just alright with me.", "rating": "3", "body": "It just was not have the impaction punch that i was expecting it to have,  Just had a minor chill effect."}, {"helpful": 1, "title": "Four Stars", "rating": "4", "body": "Not as strong as we expected."}, {"helpful": 2, "title": "Five Stars", "rating": "5", "body": "Im so high right now.

After this I spent the next few hours taking note of the effects.  They were as follows:  Nothing.  Aside from temporary numb mouth and throat, there were no noted effects, no increased relaxation, no mental or physical change whatsoever.  If I had thought it was completely a product issue, I would have given it 1 star,.. but I do think I must have some sort of resistance to Kava's effects in general,.. so I can't really fault the product there.

I heard really great things about this and finally made the plunge to order after seeing it featured on the show Booze Traveler. I looked up youtube videos on how to take it properly and yadda yadda. A lot of websites and videos made it seem like this stuff was potent and to start with a teaspoon and all kinds of other passive aggressive 'careful how you do this to see how it affects you' jargon. Then upon watching videos, people that visited native countries of this drink were downing bowl after bowl in one first time sitting... so I was conflicted. Tried a heaping teaspoon mixed in like 4oz water. Tongue was a little numb for a couple minutes, nothing noteworthy other than that. I stared into space maybe 13% more than usual, but how I felt was not different (did this with a friend, we had the same experience). I let that sit for an hour with no noteworthy side effects, then said eff it and made a small pitcher and we sipped quite a bit and made it pretty potent. Still didn't do a whole lot. I don't do drugs and have never actually even smoked a cigarette or weed. Occasional couple glasses of wine is all I get down with so I thought that it would be easy for me to identify how this affects my body. Nope. I had higher expectations for this since I visited the Dominican Republic and definitely got a unique experience drinking their native root mix 'mamajuana' so I had assumed this root mixture would have similar properties,despite being a different root I know.... I at least knew it was possible to get a buzz from roots lol... or do something besides numb my tongue for a minute. The crappy part is that studies show kava shouldn't be mixed with alcohol in the same sitting because of how it can affect your kidneys... considering what I was expecting from this stuff and didn't get, I really wanted to just drink instead. I realize nothing would (or did, I caved after being so disappointed expecting a good time) happen from drinking them both in one single night... but still. If you're looking for a euphoric experience, you'll sooner get it from a sugar rush. Just take a shot of rum or something. Or try to get your hands on some authentic mamajuana from the DR. I'll try to finish this giant bag eventually and hope I experience something different.

After this I spent the next few hours taking note of the effects.  They were as follows:  Nothing.  Aside from temporary numb mouth and throat, there were no noted effects, no increased relaxation, no mental or physical change whatsoever.  If I had thought it was completely a product issue, I would have given it 1 star,.. but I do think I must have some sort of resistance to Kava's effects in general,.. so I can't really fault the product there.

Around the world Kava Kava is used as a substitute for alcohol.

It is also said that the taste is similar to ginseng tea but I lived in South Korea for one year and drank everything from ginseng tea to pure grain ginseng alcohol and that stuff tastes like red vines in comparison. Before people knock my review I will go ahead and say, I brewed this on my second attempt (powder strained out of course) with coconut milk, honey, coca powder, cherry juice, and a banana blended together. That made it about 25% better. People also compare Kava Kava to Benzos and all I can say is they obviously have never taken Benzos. If you really want something similar to Benzos than just go see your doctor. Mine gives Valium out like it's candy and it has a very low chance of addiction. I really wanted to like this product but it's awful. The positive effects were muscle relaxation and heavy eyes but not to the point that they are worth nearly vomiting and you can get those effects from Unisom or melatonin. If you are dead set on getting a Kava Kava product than get powdered Kava root EXTRACT, not pure root powder, and make your own pills to take.

I wouldn't say that my anxiety is crippling but it is bad enough that I stammer and can't think in meetings or around large groups of people.  If you have this same problem try this supplement.  I just ordered 2 more bottles.  I take one in the morning with breakfast and then i keep a couple on me in case of a meeting or some stressful event at work pops up.  If I know in time I take one capsule and it really helps a lot!  I am really surprised because doctors have had me on prescription drugs that I always quit taking because of side effects.  I don't know if the efficacy of this Calm Now wears off if you keep taking it and you have to take more pills, but so far it is working great.  It gives you a very subtle calming effect that lasts for a long time and it takes away the jitters and anxiety feelings.  I really like this supplement!"}, {"helpful": 2, "title": "This stuff works!", "rating": "5", "body": "What can I say, I was suffering from negative moods related to heavy stress in my work place.

Boy did it, with a week my wife noticed I picked my \"pep\" back up, she noticed I was calmer, happier and in general less stressed.

Doesn't taste good to me. The taste of the bedtime is SO good!!! I know this may sound really weird but I like to sniff it while I'm drinking it while taking deep breaths. I also always drink with with honey, fresh lemon juice, & the pulp from the lemon. Something I've always done since I was young. I'm also drinking it while I'm sick that's all I am drinking & its most definitely helping with my sore throat. Not to say it's getting rid of my sore throat but it helps my sore throat like a cough drop would. Everyone must buy this tea!!!

This tea contains low level phytoestrogens that - when your hormones are too high- bring them down, and if they are too low, it fills in the gaps so your body doesn't panic - doing away with symptoms brought on by hormonal highs and lows.  Because of this tea, I stopped using the progesterone cream that I had been on for a year.  As a result, I lost 10 pounds, my skin cleared, and I don't get depressed the last half of the month - even sleeping 7 hours a night, with no night sweats- this stuff works miracles.

NO - but neither does medicine, these help by increasing your liquid intake when you are sick.

Yogi tea's are some of my favorites and I have a high opinion of them.  This tea is no exception.  The flavor quality is consistent to what I would come to expect from their products.  Just the right amount of ginger flavor that its not overpowering and flavorful.  The main issue I have with this tea (and nearly all ginger tea's I've come across) is the use of black pepper.  Many of the yogi teas come with black pepper as an ingredient, which is fine from a flavor stand point (India Spice for instance, I love the cinnamon bold flavor), but not for this tea.  About six months ago I was inflicted with stomach issues, and a huge no-no is black pepper.  The whole point of ginger tea is to calm a stomach.  So that's why I took a star away.  There is no place for black pepper in ginger tea.  I would be fine if they renamed it to \"Spicy Ginger\" and created a new Ginger tea that the sole purpose was to soothe a stomach.  Essentially it still works for calming provided I steep the bag (do not pour water over the bag, obviously) for about 10-15 seconds and promptly remove, only slightly squeezing to keep the bag from dripping.  It's weak enough that you still get the calming effects.  Alternatively, if you have the time, you can just make your own ginger tea with real ginger root.

You think, \"Hmmm, tastes much better than chamomile alone, maybe a bit of mint?  Is that a little sweet note?  I wonder what that is?\" Drinking a cup of Bedtime tea has become a nightly ritual that I share with my 2 daughters, who need that as a cue to wind down and prepare for going to bed.  They've really come to enjoy that special time we spend together at the end of the day.  That could apply to *any* tea, but this one is really special.  I had it on subscription for a while, and then all of a sudden, there was no Bedtime Tea available in the US.  Some kind of a supply problem with Yogi, I'm guessing, because No One had any.  So we tried about 8 other brands of tea, trying to find an acceptable substitute for this one.  I went on to all sorts of tea review sites and read the hipsters all say how horrible this is.  I tried what they recommended, and the brands they liked tasted like swill to us, and didn't help us get sleepy.  So each to her own.  Tea is a very personal preference and you'll just have to try it and see if it's something you like, but I can attest to the fact that it does help you get sleepy.

NO - but neither does medicine, these help by increasing your liquid intake when you are sick.

It helps me calm down from a stressful or eventful day and settle down to sleep.  The flavor is very balanced and slightly earthy, with a very slightly sweet taste from stevia that carries through as a very subtle undertone.  You think, \"Hmmm, tastes much better than chamomile alone, maybe a bit of mint?  Is that a little sweet note?  I wonder what that is?\" Drinking a cup of Bedtime tea has become a nightly ritual that I share with my 2 daughters, who need that as a cue to wind down and prepare for going to bed.  They've really come to enjoy that special time we spend together at the end of the day.  That could apply to *any* tea, but this one is really special.  I had it on subscription for a while, and then all of a sudden, there was no Bedtime Tea available in the US.  Some kind of a supply problem with Yogi, I'm guessing, because No One had any.  So we tried about 8 other brands of tea, trying to find an acceptable substitute for this one.  I went on to all sorts of tea review sites and read the hipsters all say how horrible this is.  I tried what they recommended, and the brands they liked tasted like swill to us, and didn't help us get sleepy.  So each to her own.  Tea is a very personal preference and you'll just have to try it and see if it's something you like, but I can attest to the fact that it does help you get sleepy.  Also, you can't beat the price Amazon offers, compared to the supermarket price per box.  If this is the kind of thing you drink on a daily basis, getting a carton makes sense.

The tea actually tastes quite decent, I add just one little packet of sugar to it (I'm not a huge tea fan to begin with). I haven't tried Mother's Milk, but I've heard it tastes terrible, so I was pleased with the taste of this tea as I'd been dreading trying nursing tea. I can't specifically say that this tea helps with milk production as I was working with a lactation specialist who also had me taking additional supplements at the same time. What I can say is that three times a day, I take a few moments to drink this tea, which boosts the amount of water I am consuming and lowers my stress level, two things that are very helpful when trying to boost your supply.

My somewhat painful contractions started around 9:30pm. I was prepared for the long night ahead at home. Well, by 11:30 I had to wake my husband up to go to the hospital. Once we arrived, medical personnel somewhat took their time to admit me. Guess what, when they checked I was 8.5 dilated and ready to push 20 minutes later. 7 pound baby was born at 3:24am after 6 pushes, without any pain meds. According to my husband he flew out like a rocket. And did I mention it was actually on his due date. I have been drinking this tea before getting pregnant, and then starting second trimester one bag daily, sipping for 20 minutes. During last 2 weeks I used 2 bags a day. It must be the tea, since my mom was in labor with her first for over 20 hours, same as I expected for myself. Seven days later I'm drinking it to help my body heal.
