EGCG was recommended by cancertutor.com in which the product states it will aide in shrinking tumors. I started to take it  and in a short time  the tumor felt smaller and softer. Then I quit and the size returned and the hardness. So I started taking the EGCG again and the tumor is getting smaller and softer so I will continue to take it this time since it proved that it was the tea doing it and not my other protocols. I take it twice a day and add it to water with stevia from Now's Best Stevia. The taste and the result of what it makes the tongue is tolerable for the results I am getting. The stevia helps to drink it. I also sometimes put it in with other teas. Great price and goes a long way.

The benefits of green tea are many, from a faster metabolism to antioxidants and even brain health (according to some sources).

With this product, you can get the amounts of EGCG and polyphenols you need to get the benefits from green tea (if you were to drink green tea, you would need to drink 4 or more cups to reach this level, and make sure it is brewed at the right temperature). In addition, this tea extract has vitamin C, which helps with your immune system. You get all this at a very good price. Depending on how you take it, one bottle can last from 60 to 120 days, and you only pay about 22 dollars, which is like 11 a month, a pretty good deal. Being a person who has not a lot of money, and who isn\u2019t a fan of brewing and preparing tea, and rushing to the bathroom for drinking too much tea to get the benefits, I chose this product.

My body was also showing signs of being dehydrated, so I researched green tea as I've heard that it's anti aging and also helps with metabolism, which is a plus. I've had this bottle for months but I stopped taking it daily because the last time I took it, it made throw up, so I figured my body couldn't handle it anymore. However, before that happened, I noticed I had energy. Pop made me feel sluggish, but giving up pop and taking this seemed to have reversed it. Now that I'm taking them again, I'm not hungry at all and the bloat I had before is now gone. But that could also be because I stopped drinking pop again as well.

It has diuretic effects, so it is important to drink lots of water throughout the day to reduce kidney stress. There are many great websites that describe potential side effects and drug interactions. Even though this is a naturally derived suppliment, it can be very potent and should be treated as any other type of medication.
