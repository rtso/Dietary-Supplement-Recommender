This product was recommended to me and it did not work. I got it today and was very excited to try it since I saw so many good reviews (now I am not really sure how accurate these reviews are =/ ). When I first opened the container, just a little of the powder that got in the air made my nose itchy and I started coughing, I couldn't wait to taste it after knowing that has no flavor and no added anything artificial. So I put just the tip of my finger in the container and put it in my mouth. It was SUPER itchy on my lips and I found it strange but didn't give much attention to it. A few hours later, right before gym time, I put 1 scoop in a glass and added water to it to drink. I also added a squeeze of lemon to help with the flavor. I asked my sister, who was going to the gym with me, to take a sip and see if it would make her mouth itchy too and it did. Well, now I can say that I was a little or very stupid but I wanted to take it anyways to try it out. The powder didnt dissolve properly and I didn't care for it, and since made my lips itchy early I grabed a straw and drank the whole glass at once. Oh Lord! Was just leaving the house and had to run back inside. My whole body was itchying and burning SO BAD!  I never felt like that before. I got super desperate and didn't know what to do. My husband gave me a Benadryl and nothing was changing. I couldn't touch my skin, my face got super red and felt that it was swelling, my hands and feet were terribly itching. I couldn't stand it and got in the shower. I stayed there for 30min at least and the water seemed to relief it, but as soon as I got out It was as bad as it was before the shower. Well, here I am finding some reviews from people that had the same reaction and I thought I should comment about my experience. It has been 2 hours since it happened and I am still feeling some itchiness. I am drinking lots of water and hoping it get out of my body soon if it helps. I am not allergic to anything, maybe until now, and don't really know what it is wrong it this product. As I said, had everything to be very promising but it didn't do any good.

I'm pretty religious about eating organic, using essential oils for all cleansers, not putting anything unnatural into my body, etc etc. I spent a LOT of time trying out different pre workouts, the more natural of which being Vega and PurePump. I was really disappointed with Vega, both with the fact that it doesn't mix literally at ALL in water, and PurePump tastes like food you scooped out of the garbage disposal (no joke). I tried OldSchool Labs Vintage Blast and all I can say is I won't use any other pre workout again. This stuff is legit. It kicks in about 10-20 minutes after you take it (I only use 1/2 scoop since my caffeine tolerance is low, which is great because it doubles the amount of time it takes to use it up) and it really does what it says. I get the perfect amount of caffeine to last me through a 1 1/2 hour workout, sometimes 2 depending on if I'm in off season or prep. THEN, (this is the fun part) i get another energy boost like 3-4 hours after i initially take the Blast. It's like a double whammy to get me through the rest of the afternoon.

It is a combination to supplements, eating right, eating at proper hours, and exercise.

I kept using it to see if it would wear off but I got so tired that I couldn't even go to gym. That plus the feeling of getting sick (My core body temperature seemed to rise, my ears were burning). I first thought it was something else in my diet but soon as I stopped this product, in a couple of days, I seems to return to my normal state. I went back to my normal pre workout (Which I won't name here because I don't want this to sound like a marketing ad) but once I took that, I went back to lifting like normal. Needless to say, I dont think I'll be using this product again and I threw out the rest of the powder. Money down the drain. This is a first with any of the preworkouts ive tried, and now the reviews from Amazon seems highly suspect. Again, it might be my body reacting differently to it.

I was devout to N.O. X-plode for a long time. But I like to mix it up and decided to try something else.  With that, Vintage Blast works extremely well. I have tried a lot of pre-workouts, and this one gives me the energy and focus to workout all the way through tough days and still feel it afterwards. I don't get the itchy, crawly sensation as I did with other pre-workouts. I also don't get the post-workout crash where I have to sit around after a solid workout, which defeats the purpose of wanting to be active. And the flavor is really good, if you like sour lemonade. It's like a cheap, acceptable version of Country Time Lemonade mix, flavor-wise.", "title": "An honest, non-gushing review", "rating": "4"}, {"helpful": 0, "body": "I've tried samples of pre-workouts before, but I would always have a jittery feeling... which was weird for me since I have a very high caffeine tolerance.

I have tried several different products, but I have to say, I have gone back to Vintage blast and it is the only one I will use from now on.  I am not a body builder.  I am a 34 year old male and as I mentioned earlier, I do p90x and insanity which involve a lot of cardio.  C4 was another popular supplement that I had tried.  While it did provide a boost and was decent for weights, I had to discontinue use on my cardio days as I feared I was going to have a heart attack (it caused a scary rapid pounding in my chest.)  Vintage Blast for me, is the perfect solution.  First off, Vintage blast gives me the boost I need without making me a jittery mess.  Secondly, it provides the punch I need for weight training, and keeps me going strong on my cardio workouts without the \"my heart is about to explode\" feeling.  It lasts longer and provides a more steady energy that carries into my work day.  Also, it is more gentle on my digestive system than any other product I have tried.  But the best thing of all is that here are no mystery ingredients!  It is all-natural and NON-HABIT forming (which was a concern of mine)!!

I feel compelled to write this review based on the side effects I have observed with this product. Having said that I think it's fair to point out the same supplement may have different effects on different people. The first time I used the product, I thought I felt positive effect in strength while lifting. I'm not sure if this was psychological because the next few times I started shutting down 20 minutes into my workouts and felt tired. This state of lethargy would continue on for hours. I kept using it to see if it would wear off but I got so tired that I couldn't even go to gym. That plus the feeling of getting sick (My core body temperature seemed to rise, my ears were burning). I first thought it was something else in my diet but soon as I stopped this product, in a couple of days, I seems to return to my normal state. I went back to my normal pre workout (Which I won't name here because I don't want this to sound like a marketing ad) but once I took that, I went back to lifting like normal. Needless to say, I dont think I'll be using this product again and I threw out the rest of the powder. Money down the drain. This is a first with any of the preworkouts ive tried, and now the reviews from Amazon seems highly suspect. Again, it might be my body reacting differently to it.

I like the stevia instead of sugar and I like the balance of ingredients- it follows along with research I have done on how best to supplement your work out. Also this company lists the actual amount of the ingredients which really sets it apart from other workout supplements.. I work out very early in the morning before work and not being a morning person I need this. It lasts a long time too so I always wish I could work out longer, I usually feel a second \"pump\" coming on once I'm back home getting ready for work- it's OK because I have a really busy job so running around like a monkey on crack is fine. For me- the crash hits pretty hard about ten hours later and I still have to get through 3 hours of work but what do you expect?  I will say that by the end of my last container, I didn't feel like it was working as well but figured my caffeine tolerance was creeping up (I only use this stuff 2-3 times a week but drink coffee on the other days). But then I got the new container and took a scoop and thought they must have mixed in some meth or something because I was bouncing off the walls.

When taking C4 within 30 min I would feel tingling, more alert and ready to workout. When I took this last night I felt nothing. Literally nothing, to the point that I actually forgot I took it while walking my dog and waiting for it to kick in. I then went to the gym and felt ZERO noticeable difference versus if I just went on a cup of coffee. One claim they have right, is there is no crash which is great, problem is there's no pump either. I feel more from a starbucks grande cup of coffee. So not sure what all the hype is about but this definitely doesn't even compete with the big name pre-workouts out there. If you want to really feel a pump and tinge, go with one of the big guys like c4 or jacked3d. If you just want to feel more awake, alert, and focused but don't want the crazy pump and tingling then go with one of the natural products out there like organic muscle or natural force.

I was wrong. I don't care about taste because thats not what the product is for, but the taste was decent. This review is strictly on the effects of the product, and it was horrible. The 2 stage pre work out is a selling point that is not true. I took this about 15 times trying different doses and every time got the same effect. I would take it have a 10 minute boost of energy 30 minutes later and then felt like I needed to take a 5 hour nap. I had 3 friends try it as well and we all got the same effect. I was very disappointed for a lot of reasons. 1 because its only 20 servings. IT'S EXPENSIVE. and simply because it was one of the worst pre work outs I have taken.

Love the fact that I only see 4 ingredients on the bottle and was able to read them too;). Thank you soooo much guys for really doing a great job, keep up the good work.

Now, obviously after more than one use my opinion could change in time and if it does I will update. The taste was good, a lemonade flavor to it, but not overly sweet. It mixes very well and there were no clumps left in the bottom of the cup after I finished it. I did feel a boost in energy after taking the product and was able to break through a plateau in weight that I had been stuck on for 2 weeks or so and actually lifted more than I ever have in a single workout session. Maybe I was just having a really good day, but I think the product really did help. The only issue I have with it at this point is that the serving size and directions say to use 1 scoop, but it does not come with a scoop utensil. This really didn't bother me, I just used a scoop from a previous supplement since they are usually all the same. But it would have been a bonus if it had its own scoop so I could know for sure what size scoop they mean.

Let me explain this product. First of all, I ordered this and it shipped to my door in like 2 days so I didn't have to wait long for it to come. Now, I decided to wait until this morning to use it and workout. This is my very first day using it. When I used it it said to use 4 to 8 oz of water. DO NOT DO! Now, I admit that I did feel the energy kick in after only about 10 or 15 minutes for me and I decided to go ahead and hit the gym early somewhat afraid that the energy would wear a bit thin, it's just the way I am. The reason I say don't use 4 to 8 oz of water is because on some of the reviews I read when I was about to buy this product, I saw people say they somewhat felt dehydrated after using it. Again this is my first day using it and I can tell you that I didn't make it through 20 minutes of my workout before I had to call it quits. In my opinion, I felt as if I didn't use enough water, and this product definitely opened my eyes to the fact that I really need to start drinking more water. So when you take this product do not just use 4 to 8 oz of water unless you want the gym to be your final resting place. Now, don't get me wrong, again I felt the energy kick in and maybe it was because I didn't wait the whole 30 or 45 minutes to workout and I may have rushed myself a bit. But common sense told me that water was the main factor of it. So you definitely want to drink water throughout the entire day. I say at the least drink about a 12 oz. Although it's a tiny scooper, if you do choose to follow the directions (which I wouldn't recommend) go for 8 oz, especially if you don't drink water throughout the day as it is. Now on to the taste. I really don't get why the taste is such a big deal nowwa days with protein and mass gainers etc, but this is actually okay. The guys who wouldn't like this, is the guys who don't like fruit punch or guys who just have high standards on something that's helping them out. Although this is has a pretty good taste, I say think of medicine. Medicine sucks, but it helps big time. This doesn't taste like medicine of anything, I just wanted to get that out there. I'll end by saying this, again this is my first day using this, and I think you guys would like this. This is a pretty hard working protein, and I can tell this will give you that 50% help, all you have to do is give the other 50% and you'll accomplish what you're trying to accomplish in no time. Like I told you (and I know you're probably tired of hearing this) drink lots of water. It's a small price to pay for the big results you'll get. I'll do another review on this in a couple of weeks to keep you updated.

I love fresh pineapple but I typically don't like artificial pineapple flavoring, so I was somewhat apprehensive but I bought it due to the savings (this was before fruit punch 30 serving size was so cheap). I was expecting to be choking the pineapple-mango down but I am pleasantly surprised at the taste. The pineapple is a little stronger than the mango, overall it's refreshing without overpowering. It doesn't have that faux-pineapple flavor that I hate. While it's not the tastiest pre-workout I've ever had, it's nowhere near the worst.

In short, creatine is an ATP transporter and beta-alanine serves as a pH buffer for acid build-up within the muscles. In other words, once saturated, you will be able to \"pump\" out a few more reps each set. According to the law of progressive overload, that is EXACTLY what you want! The recommended daily intake is 3-5 grams for each creatine and beta-alanine. In one serving, this product contains 2.5 grams and 2 grams, respectively.

I can take this before an endurance event like biking or running or before strength training with great energy either way.

Assault is one of the few pre-workouts that gives me noticeable gains without ever making me shaky. I've tried watermelon, blue raspberry, and raspberry lemonade flavors, all were strong. I'm writing this review for the pineapple mango flavor. I grabbed it because I'm on a budget and this was the only flavor offered in the 50 serving size. I love fresh pineapple but I typically don't like artificial pineapple flavoring, so I was somewhat apprehensive but I bought it due to the savings (this was before fruit punch 30 serving size was so cheap). I was expecting to be choking the pineapple-mango down but I am pleasantly surprised at the taste. The pineapple is a little stronger than the mango, overall it's refreshing without overpowering. It doesn't have that faux-pineapple flavor that I hate. While it's not the tastiest pre-workout I've ever had, it's nowhere near the worst.

While this is marketed as a \"pre-workout\" it is not necessary to take right before your routine. The reason being creatine and beta-alanine, which happen to be the most scientifically researched supplements available, require a saturation within the muscle cells to produce the desired effects. In short, creatine is an ATP transporter and beta-alanine serves as a pH buffer for acid build-up within the muscles. In other words, once saturated, you will be able to \"pump\" out a few more reps each set. According to the law of progressive overload, that is EXACTLY what you want! The recommended daily intake is 3-5 grams for each creatine and beta-alanine. In one serving, this product contains 2.5 grams and 2 grams, respectively. Also, this supplement does contain branched chain amino acids, additional ingredients for increased absorption rates, and it has a little caffeine (so, I generally don't take it at night)!", "title": "A Relevant Review for Consistent Gym Goers", "rating": "5"}, {"helpful": 5, "body": "This is one of my first trials of a pre exercise drink supplement.

The taste is decent (I've been taking it for so long I don't even really remember what it tastes like since I just gulp it down...but it's not nasty, and I've tasted a lot of nasty powders in the search for health and energy). I put it dry in my shaker bottle and then add water at the rink and then drink it about 15-30 minutes before hitting the ice. I also use the Recovery powder and the Performance Protein afterwards (I use an electrolyte powder during play, but not the Vega brand) and I actually do feel that the combination helps me play more hockey and recover more quickly. Of course I do a lot of dry land stretching and eat an anti-inflammatory diet as well, which helps. But when I was less diligent about the body work and nutrition, I felt like the combo of the products worked well. (and no I don't work for Vega nor a review writing company. Vega should be paying me for how much I use their product and say how decent it is).

This fits those requirements.  Now for its effectiveness.  Since this is anecdotal, I will acknowledge that this may be mental, but I'm believe that a lot of what it takes to push through a tough workout is mental.  This powder gets me 'amped' for a workout.  The more tangible ingredients are the caffeine and beta-alanine.  The caffeine is definitely there; prior to a workout it helps clear the fog.  The beta-alanine tingle (paresthesia) is noticeable as well.  For the other effects purported by the ingredient list, I trust the body of research done on them (creatine, in particular) to gain these benefits.  TFlavor-wise, I rotate a few right now that I store in various locations (office, house, suitcase) and since it's down to personal preference, I'll equate the flavors the best I can.  Watermelon = Jolly Rancher Watermelon (which to me is awesome).  Fruit Punch = Gatorade's Fruit Punch (also good), Blueberry Lemonade = Dum Dum Lollipop (hard to describe this one, definitely more lemony than anything, but it is  pretty good), and Pineapple = (Definitely not pineapple.

Product Is Garbage", "rating": "1"}, {"helpful": 1, "body": "First, I'm not a body builder or obsessed with the Gym. But in May of this year I started a special diet (Alkaline Diet) to lose weight and become more healthy overall. I was 205 lbs when I started the diet and as of today, Oct. 7th, I'm 167 lbs. I'm 42 and about 5' 9\" tall. Now I did a lot of research on the Alkaline Diet and what Supplements to consume and of course what to eat and what not to eat. For breakfast a Whey Protein Powder was highly suggested with Soy Milk. So after researching Whey Protein Powders I found that Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein was the best one. BTW, the double rich chocolate with the Soy Milk tastes great. My first order of the Whey Protein powder included a free sample of the Pre-Workout fruit punch powder. I put the sample aside because at the time I was just dieting and not working out. I wasn't even a member of a Gym yet. After about 3 months of my diet I was close to my goal weight and began taking walks to lose those stubborn few extra pounds and be in even better physical shape. Once I could see and feel the results of my dieting and walking almost every day I decided to go even further and joined the Edge Fitness Gym around the beginning of September. After going to the Gym a few weeks about 3 times a week I remembered I had the sample of the Pre-Workout mix. So I followed the directions to mix it with 8 oz of water a half hour before going to the Gym. I started with cardio as I always do but within 15 minutes of being on that treadmill I felt like pushing myself further than I had in my first few weeks of being at the Gym. Point is that instead of 30 minutes of cardio I did almost an hour and ran/jogged through most of it and was drenched by the time I was done. Not once before I had this Pre-Workout mix did I ever have that kind of motivation and energy. After the cardio I did an hour of weights (upper and lower body) and was there just over 2 hours. Before the pre-workout mix my Gym sessions were no where near what I did that day. I track everything since I began walking in August on my iPhone and using a Fitbit Charge HR so I know what I've accomplished in a given day and that day was great. So I obviously knew this made the difference that day. So I read a lot of the reviews here on Amazon about this powder and ordered it. Since then my workouts are longer and I always find myself pushing even harder at the Gym. Now as others have pointed out some of the ingredients are not considered to be the best \"all natural\" ones but with me still following the strict Alkaline Diet those few ingredients the days I go to the Gym are not going to negativity effect me. The added boost this powder mix gives me every time I use it is so noticeable that only if I don't want to end up being at the Gym for 2 hours would I not take it. The fruit punch flavor tastes fine and like others have mentioned it does not FULLY dissolve no matter how well you stir it, but boy does it do the job. The price is great and it works for me.

I've tried everything, from 5 hr energy, to Amazing Grass (Whole Foods) to other pre-workouts, etc. I used to primarily use Do Vitamins Pure Pump before this (I'm big on more natural, organic blends if I can help it) and liked that, but hated the creatine additive. I'm not looking to bulk up, I'm looking to lean out and lose weight. Red Leaf's pre-workout has been great so far in helping me slim down to fit in my wedding dress! This combined with exercise and following my meal plan (healthy eating, non processed, whole foods) helped me cut 6 lbs in 2 weeks. I love the flavor! And love that the color comes from natural sources, not food dyes. You get a tingling sensation in the beginning (which helps to know it's working) and then it's on!

I tried a number of food options as I eat very clean and rarely put anything processed into my body. The trouble came in when I began getting nauseous after about ten minutes of intense exercise. I went back to fasting before and made it through without so much as a hint of nausea. I decided to try some pre-workouts from the top supplement chains in the US.
