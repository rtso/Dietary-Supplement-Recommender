But I still needed to work on healing the gut and stepping further down this path of healthy living.  No matter how healthy I ate, I still was experiencing some IBS.  Typical allopathic doctors simply want to throw drugs and even surgery at you.  Few want to address the root of the issues.  I had read many times that probiotics are one of the puzzle pieces in the whole healthy living picture.  So, I ordered these.  I started taking them 6 days ago and I've had 5 days of very good, healthy results. (the first day, I think my body did a small adjustment period of stalling and wait-and-see. I had no problems - I simply experienced  nothing.

I was going a little more regularly due to things being able to be digested faster.  Bloating was also minimized.  I tried taking 8 a day, and I noticed even better digestion, and bloating was minimal even after eating pastries.  So basically, if you're gonna eat junk, you're gonna need to take more, but if you eat a vegan or whole foods diet, you may only need 2 a day.  I don't eat strictly either or, so I make sure to take more (usually before and after eating) if I'm going to gorge on some cherry turnovers for dessert.

I tried taking 8 a day, and I noticed even better digestion, and bloating was minimal even after eating pastries.  So basically, if you're gonna eat junk, you're gonna need to take more, but if you eat a vegan or whole foods diet, you may only need 2 a day.  I don't eat strictly either or, so I make sure to take more (usually before and after eating) if I'm going to gorge on some cherry turnovers for dessert.

For the people who are constipated I may be able to help you. My friend over 3 weeks ago told me what I can do to help my severe constipation that I used to have. I suffered so bad and it was so painful to go and I could never lose weight. I even eat pretty healthy, drinking lots of water and trying to get a lot of fiber in my diet (that didn't even help). I used to use the restroom once every 4-5 days. I had severe headaches everyday. I also used to have bad insomnia as well. I purchased three different products and in writing this review, I am going to just paste the same review for reviews in all 3 of the products that I purchased.  I have no more headaches, less fatigued, and I sleep better. I purchased a digestive enzyme, a good probiotic, and magnesium citrate supplements. What I have learned is that we need good bacteria back in our guts. Then the most shocking thing I learned is that so many of us are magnesium deficient. Please, I encourage you to read about magnesium deficiency. It's so hard to test for magnesium deficiency because around only 1% is found in our blood. The rest of the magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues. I first must say that if you are vitamin D deficient you should well of course consult a doctor first but you will need your vitamin D levels to be good in order to take magnesium. The vitamin D blood test is very accurate and I was once deficient. The reason is magnesium, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K2 all go together. The magnesium will store better in your body if your vitamin D levels are at where they are supposed to be. I continue to take 6,000 units of vitamin D3 everyday. I live in Michigan and I get no sun. Most people are getting too much calcium and not nearly enough magnesium. I have read that the ratio for calcium to magnesium for most people is 5:1. It should be calcium and magnesium 1:1. I eat foods with dairy and my calcium levels were healthy. The magnesium product that I bought may also be sold with calcium in it. I did not purchase that one because I already have enough calcium in my system but I didn't have any magnesium due to all the symptoms. There are not that many foods that contain magnesium. Honestly, I do not eat spinach and nuts all day long to get the magnesium our bodies need. Magnesium is amazing and it helps with so many symptoms. Magnesium will help you sleep better and has helped so many with insomnia. Magnesium helps with the osmosis in your digestive track. Magnesium can help maintain your heart to be healthy, helps with blood pressure, body aches, reduce headaches, helps with insulin resistance, some fibromyalgia people, helps people with asthma because it opens up the bronchioles so that people can breathe better, and so many more. Now, there are different forms of magnesium that you can take and the dosage for all different types are different. I take magnesium in the form of citarte. This form is very good for people who are suffering from constipation. The supplement I use is in a powder form and I add it to warm water at night before bed. I use 2 measured teaspoons that may be rounded on top  every night. These two measured teaspoons equal to around 325 mg a day which is the daily value of 81%. My constipation is cured. I am also hypothyroid and even taking thyroid medication I was still constipated. I have learned everything I mentioned above after I purchased the three products. I wanted to make sure that all this stuff is safe, right amount in using it, and why it's working so well (that's when I learned so much about magnesium). So, I thought I would share my experience and hopefully help some of you out there suffering with constipation. I will post three links at the bottom of all the stuff that I bought. I bought everything off of Amazon. I would like to say that I believe out of all 3 products that I purchased I feel that the most important one in curing my constipation is the product Natural Vitality Nature Calm product. I don't know if my constipation would have been cured with just taking the probiotics and the digestive enzymes. I purchased those two products because I feel that they are important as well in keeping good bacteria in your gut with the probiotics and the enzyme with the help of breaking down our food. I feel that the Nature Calm Magnesium is the main reason for going to the bathroom everyday and relieving my other symtoms."}, {"title": "Keeps things moving", "rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "body": "This is a product where specifics about performance are probably not preferred in a review."}, {"title": "Four Stars", "rating": "4", "helpful": 0, "body": "Good price on a brand I always buy.They were delivered in the time frame promised."}, {"title": "No more tummy troubles!!!", "rating": "5", "helpful": 1, "body": "I have been using this product for months now.

I think, as it is an excellent brand, and the probiotics generally work in the same way, any of these types of Culturelle will be effective for the usage you need it for.

All due to daycare. The doc had warned us that if our son developed another ear infection he would require tubes and I was horrified to hear that this is a common practice - my son was EBF to 6 months and continued to BF until 14 months and eats only whole, organic foods that I cook at home for him...so how is this even possible? I decided as a last resort to try a probiotic - I had given him one when he was just a couple of weeks old to help with gas pains/colic and it worked extremely well - we literally had the happiest, easiest baby on the block. I liked that Bio-kult has multiple bacteria strains, which is important because multiple strains act to support each other and form a stronger \"army\" against pathogens than just one strain alone. Most other probiotics can't offer as many (unless you make your own milk kefir.)  This has made a huge difference in my son's health - he's fought off two colds on his own now without any antibiotics or other meds (I usually give him just one capsule a day, but 2-3 when he's sick.) Also, he eats all kinds of whole foods, including a lot of protein and healthy fats, and his digestion is extremely regular - he's never constipated or gassy.

The moral of this story is that if you need to take this probiotic on a daily basis and don't want the supply to be interrupted, don't go to this seller. When I order things from the European Amazon, for instance, they arrive in the US within two weeks. When private parties send me parcels in the mail, they arrive within ten days.

I had reached my wit's end, so I started researching natural ways to ease my digestive issues. I'd been doing well using papaya enzyme and peppermint oil, but they only help the symptoms of you catch them very early on, and even then I was still having attacks, they were just minor. Anyway, I had my daughter when I was 30 and during my pregnancy my attacks happened at least once a week for my entire first trimester. I was miserable, and at my wit's end decided to try probiotics on a whim.  I went for Digestive Advantage first and although they were ok, I didn't like all the junky ingredients. So I started looking up higher quality brands and voila! Udo's Choice. My life has changed. I haven't had an attack since my first trimester of pregnancy, and my daughter's 3.5.

She gave me a two week supply of Florastor to take with the antibiotics; apparently Florastor is a yeast and survives in the digestion system longer than other probiotics.  My symptoms completely resolved.  After taking the Florastor for about a month and a half, I went on a business trip and forgot my Florastor at home. After being off the Florastor for 24 hours, I had some tasty Thai food and my stomach started cramping like it did before I started taking these pills.  I found the nearest pharmacy, purchased some Florastor, and within 2 hours the cramping had stopped and my stomach quieted down.  I was shocked (and relieved!).  Now I recommend this to anyone who has digestive issues and will probably stay on it for the rest of my life."}, {"title": "Best Probiotic oin the Market", "rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "body": "I had heard about Florastor from my doctor but was hesitant to try due to the cost.

But alas, here is the review based on my two boys' reaction.  We have used the other brand of chewable tablets for 3 years, with no problems and much love by the boys, but the manufacturer has stopped making them exact same way and changed ingredients.  So I thought to try a new brand.  The older boy did not like it at all, and never wanted to try it again.  He said he did not like the chewy feeling in the his mouth.  The younger boy (who is not very talking yet) ate them just fine, every day.  But every day his stool was too soft, right after breakfast and all day.  Not sure if there is  a direct link, but I decided to put them away, and now his stool is normal again.

These taste great, and when I don't take these or another type of Primadophilus, yeast overgrowth because of antibiotic use tends to really cause some awful symptoms -- definitely a great product.  However, I only received one of the 2-pack from Amazon.com and though I sent in a \"missing\" request via the automated system (since there is no phone or email support), I've never received the other Primadophilus bottle.  So it ended up being twice as expensive as it was supposed to be, along with the frustration of trying to get it resolved (and not succeeding) with Amazon.  I order a lot of things from Amazon and think that most of their prices and customer service are great, but trying to get the \"other half\" of the order was a total bust.  I would send back the 1 bottle if I had it to do again and explain that I never received the 2-bottle pack.

IMO, these are simply the best on the market, and much better than the \"regular\" Primal Defense.  After reading some bad reviews, I wanted to point out a few things others may find helpful.  First off, probiotics aren't magic, and if they are magic to some folks, that's great!!  But let me take this a step further.  Mostly everyone that has bowel problems, and allergy problems especially, have leaky gut syndrome.  If you are REALLY sensitive to this product, you probably have leaky gut and will never recover if you don't heal your intenstinal tract.  I have found great recovery with a couple of products that some may find helpful:  Colostrum LD and MSM (both vendors are here at Amazon).  I have been on high doses of both of these and I feel better than I have in years.  I used to have severe bloating, extreme fatigue, severe food allergies/sensitivies, extreme chemical sensitivies, carb sensitivity, skin problems, cravings, IBS symptoms, uveitis (corneal inflammation), etc.....but I always tried to do my own research because I knew doctors caused all of this to begin with by keeping me on antibiotics constantly.  Please keep in mind that if you have a severe case of leaky gut syndrome, probiotics may not work well for you and you'll probably never *fully* recover.  Also, certain strains of probiotics work better for certain symptoms than others.  If I took a certain probiotic for IBS, I would get worse constipation because that strain of probiotic is for people with diarrhea.  Lesson learned.  Also, if you have candida problems, I find it's best to start out with Syntol and then go to this brand.  Syntol is great and very helpful.  But saying all of that to say, this particular probiotic has helped me tremendously and I don't ever want to be without it.  To actually have energy and function like a normal person is great!"}, {"title": "Gut Dysbiosis after taking Primal Defense", "rating": "1", "helpful": 3, "body": "I have been using Primal Defense for 2 years.

It's the only probiotic I use. Garden of Life is a great company and it's known for their probiotics.

For these to work best though (when your ready), they should be consumed on an empty stomach. Basically it's going to feel like a war in your stomach...good bacteria vs bad bacteria...so it's going to be a little painful for the first few times. But after that, it's great.

I'm on my 5th day and writing a review already if that is any indication of how awesome this stuff is! So I have IBS, I go back and forth between straining and running to the bathroom, but unfortunately for the past 2 years I've been mostly in the straining mode because of a severe, almost deadly kidney infection (sepsis) and months worth of antibiotics. My intestines and the lack of good bacteria are wreaking havoc on me. It's stress and diet also, I know this, but yet even when I try to change my diet, I don't see much of a difference. I have tried other probiotics, upping my yogurt intake etc. Nothing has really helped me have consistently good BM's that don't feel hard as granite and the size of mini-butterfinger (sorry for the description). So I started taking this Thursday evening with my dinner, we had a pretty large meal at Outback so this was the perfect test to see how uncomfortably bloated and stopped up I would be after dinner. As I started through my appetizers and salad, I started feeling a pretty uncomfortable stomach ache, 15 minutes later when my entree arrived it was gone. Okay cool, whatever, that was weird. I noticed when the meal was over I didn't have the overly bloated feeling I normally have after I eat, still a little there, but tolerable. Friday I noticed all day that after I would eat I was not as bloated or uncomfortable. Saturday, oh Saturday... I finally had to go to the bathroom. It wasn't the painful experience I was used to which was amazing, but also, I wasn't expecting to see what I did in the toilet after I was finished. I said out loud OH MY GOD! The hubby heard me lol! I know, I'm sorry for the TMI, but when you're used to straining to barely see any progress and then all of a sudden the damn toilet bowl is almost full and with little to no effort put into it, I'm saying Halle-freakin-lujah! It has been like that every day since I've been taking it. Even after getting pretty tipsy that Saturday night, my husband asked me Sunday if I had the \"beer s***s\" yet that we all get after doing a bit of drinking.. NOPE! Fully intact and NO looseness at all. I haven't stepped on the scales but I'm sure I've even lost a little weight with how well my digestion has been.

I started taking it when I was in college because I had an incredibly noisy stomach so loud that I would skip classes so I could skip the embarrassment of everyone looking at me (it sounded like I hadn't fed it for days, and it could be heard from clear across the room).  I did tons of google searching, tried different products like beano, charcoal pills, etc.  But none of those worked.  Then I started using Accuflora -- two pills every morning and two at night -- and after a few days, my stomach doesn't make crazy noises anymore.  I've been able to decrease the number of pills now that my gut has \"normalized\", so now, a couple years after starting, I only take one pill every morning.  I still have some stomach noises, they're just little mouse whispers compared to what they originally were, and now I have no more anxiety about being in a classroom or an office meeting.  It sounds silly, but that stomach noise was making me miss out on so much of my life.  Then a couple years later, my now-husband, then-boyfriend, had the nastiest flatulence.  The smell was horrendous... and seemingly constant!  He finally took my advice to take the pills (because not only did they make my stomach noises decrease by quite a bit, they also made my gas not stink), and now he has stink-free gas.  This product has done wonders for myself, my husband, and our relationship (ha!).

I try to stop drinking anything 20-30 minutes before eating, and then I wait at least an hour after eating before drinking anything, even water.

Makes sense to me, and in real life application I have seen serious results.  It's hard at first, especially not having a glass of wine at dinner or something, but it is worth it to wait!

When you take an antibiotic treatment, many bacteria in your system are depleted, both good and bad bacteria.  When finished with an antibiotic run, think of your body as a hotel that's nearly completely empty after this antibiotic treatment.  One of two things can then happen 1) bad bacteria can multiply and your hotel (ie, your intestinal system) can have a population of bad bacterium or 2) good bacteria can multiply and your hotel can be filled with good bacteria.  Or obviously some combination of both.  You want to keep your body in balance and try to promote the good bacteria as much as possible.

Granted they made me want to purchase the product in the first place but after going thru exactly 41 of those \"pearls\" I can honestly they don't work for me at all. And in a way it's a relief because they never made me feel good once. Quite the opposite; they made everything worst. But, I was in denial, thinking it must be something I ate, I ate too fast, too much, didn't have enough water etc, etc... Constipated, bloated, cramps, you name it. It got so bad I started on a food journal again last week, keeping tab on everything that goes into my mouth for bfast, lunch and dinner. The last time I kept that journal, and I kept it up for over three months because that's how long it took me to identify each and every reaction to each and every food I was consuming, the results were pretty clear: slight but very real and annoying wheat intolerance, especially whole wheat, total soy intolerance, and slight dairy intolerance. Not even my GI could figure that one out with all the tubes he inserted here and there. The kicker to those results? I travelled to Europe shortly thereafter for almost three weeks and guess what? No symptoms, no intolerance to anything. People are poisoning us here and I don't say this lightly. I stopped dairy products, brown rice and tofu, and looked for all the other way they label \"soy\" and soy derivatives in my supplements. Everything I buy in non-GMO, vitamins included. Until I decided to sort of replace the acidophilus I was no longer getting from the milk, yogurt and cheese. Big mistake, all the symptoms I have been combatting for years came back! Tonight I can't sleep because I'm not only bloated, my stomach is distented and hard like I'm pregant, but I also have painful cramps. So I come here on Amazon and read the bad reviews which I had never bothered to read before and surprise, that stuff is made of GMO soy, a double big no-no. I'm so relieved. I have shrinked my portions to a point where I can't shrink them anymore, I will finally be able to ingest more that a green juice or a hard boiled egg in the mornings, and my stomach will go back to being somewhat flat and soft. Not to even mention the bathroom part (because thanks to this stuff, I was back on prescription laxative the GI had prescribed last year).
