So, I continued to take these B-vitamins from all sorts of brands that I would find at Target or CVS.

I was driving, so I just left it on as I listened. In this video, I learned that B-12 vitamins come in 3 forms. The most common form is cyanocobalamin, which most cheap B vitamins and multi-vitamins have. This is the form of B-12 that makes your piss turn deep yellow, because your body absorbs so little of it. Then they go on to explain that Methylcobalamin is the most effective form of B-12 that you can digest. This form actually is absorbed by your body.

I'm not a full blown vegetarian but I am working on reducing my consumption of meat  and animal products. However, since B-12 comes from animal sources, I know I needed a supplement. I read that B 12 protects nerve and brain cells from free radical damage, helps to reduce pain associated with neuropathy, supports the immune system, improves mood, and increases energy levels. However, not all B-12 supplements are created equal. Some contain Cyanocobalamin, which is a synthetic form of B 12, which makes it very cheap. The cyanide in this type of B-12 is not considered dangerous, but it does require the body to use energy to convert and remove it. Methylcobalamin is the most active form of B-12 and helps to protect the cardiovascular system as well as being able to cross the blood-brain barrier to protect the brain. This product is vegan friendly and contains methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalmin, the two most bioactive forms of B-12, so there is no need to worry about cyanide. Adenosylcobalmin is the least stable form of the 4 types of B-12 and it's hard to find it in supplements. It is naturally occurring and necessary for the Citric Acid cycle, which is the chemical reaction that happens in our bodies to generate energy from carbohydrates, fats and proteins.

Instinctively, I knew that with my low energy, I needed more B-12. I searched and searched until I found this product. I had heard that the only way you could take too much B-12 was to fill your bathtub full of it and drown yourself in it. So I began to take more than one per day. I was actually noticing a slight difference in my body. I decided that I would go back to this product on Amazon and read the reviews. I ordered it initially not on the reviews, but on the fact of the ingredients. One of my favorite things to do is read the reviews. You can learn so much from the people that order and their reviews. From this I learned of Dr. Ben Lynch's website, the originator of these supplements. I began to search his website, and found more supplements for MTHFR. I am taking one Homocystex Plus after breakfast and one Optimal Sleep. One of the results is that I am no longer waking up at night with a terrile case of hives.That is huge for me. My wonderful husband would wake up and rub my skin for about 15 minutes til they went away. If they lasted much longer, they would be unbearable. I have just started taking the Optimal Amino Blend, but my main goal now is to find a doctor in my area that will help me go forward.", "helpful": 8, "title": "One of my favorite things to do is read the reviews"}, {"rating": "5", "body": "I read so many excellent testimonials about B-12, and specifically about this brand.

Also, I am experiencing a dramatic increase in my energy level, which is so amazing.  Finally, my mood is definitely more positive and even-keeled.  I don't know if this is due to better sleep, or yet another benefit to my brain of the B-12, but it doesn't matter.  I've been taking this supplement now for a month, so I am sure that all these great results are not due to my ability to just 'talk myself into' believing what others have said.

Active B-12 is a proverbial \"prince\"  of supplements for me. Since starting this product about 5 weeks ago, I have had almost no \"poor mood\" days, meaning that I have been able to basically eliminate taking SAM-e, which I had used to treat an occasional poor mood.  I do not know what my MTHFR genetic status is, (I plan to take the $99 \"23andme\" test soon) but I'd wager that I have one of these MTHFR genetic variants, since the Active B-12 seems to work so well for me. Since the Active B is required by the body at the beginning of the methylation cycle, I now no longer seem to need the SAMe, which is one of the end products of the methylation cycle. Active B12 is also cheaper than exorbitantly priced SAMe.  The combination of this product-- together with my elimination of Aspartame and Glyphosate (Roundup) drenched Wheat products--- has almost completely restored my mental wellbeing!! (I can still have a little bit of organic King Arthur flour with no problems, but I generally stay away from glyphosate poisoned wheat-- and almost all wheat in America is sprayed with Roundup before harvest to prompt seed production and evenness of ripening.)

I stumbled upon this product because a number of years ago, I had noticed that an LA Weight Loss B Vitamin supplement that I had taken  had worked very well in brightening my mood.  Unfortunately,  I was never able to get the same mood brightening effect using other  synthetic B supplements over the years... and I had no idea that not all B vitamins are the same, and that many people require the \"methyl\" form of B vitamins. (The synthetic Bs actually sometimes worsened my mood which was paradoxical)...  Unbeknownst to me, I needed the Methyl B's all those years!!

I have to say that I don't like stevia, which it does contain, but I can't taste the stevia and quite like the taste of this product.  I think I like it too much because I sometimes take two or three pumps and now, based on recent blood tests, my B-12 levels are off the charts.  I don't think that's an issue, but I'm only using it occasionally now until my B-12 levels fall to a normal range. I had read the reviews in advance so I knew it had to be refrigerated and so have not had the issues that others have.  The reason that I only gave it four stars is that I was looking for it to solve my energy problems, and it did not.  I have recently discovered Ashwagandha and that has helped my energy tremendously.", "helpful": 1, "title": "Tastes good, organic, and effective"}, {"rating": "4", "body": "Followed the advice of fellow reviewers & keep in fridge.

I did not feel more awake, better mood or more energized while taking it. Maybe I needed to take it for a longer period of time but just did not get that chance. So for those looking to buy this product id say it seems to be the luck of the draw, you might get a good one and if you do id say its worth your money, but I'm not chancing it again on this one myself.

One caveat: after spraying, some of the product drips out of a little bit out at the end, so there's always some of the liquid that runs down the spray part and the cap when you put it back on. I purchased the D3 spray too, both straight from Amazon, and they both have this issue, so I don't think it's an issue with just mine (I'm curious if anyone else has this issue?).
