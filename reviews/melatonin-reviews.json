I have a job where my team (of four people) work 4 months on \"Days\", and then work 4 months of \"Nights\" (4 people covering 16:30 - 07:00 and staggering hours to cover that time period).  When on nights, I was finding it difficult to get to sleep when I got home, and often found myself having several naps in lieu of a reasonable number of hours of uninterrupted sleep.  I tried taking one of these about 20 minutes before going to bed, and it helped.  I then tried two, and I think I've finally found my magic potion!  I found that if I take two of these, and avoid television and other \"smart glass devices\" that are back-lit (such as Android tablets, iPads, iPhones, etc), and then lie down, I get that perfect amount of \"push\" to fall asleep and stay asleep.  Two \"best parts\", are 1) I don't wake up feeling groggy or \"drugged\", like I used to feel with some other \"sleep aids\".  2) I don't have any problem DREAMING when I sleep.  Some other \"sleep aids\" basically knock you out and deprive you of REM sleep.  That kind of sleep does not do a body much good.  Without REM sleep, your body will get a chance to rest and recover, but your brain will feel like you never slept.  Sleeping with a normal amount of REM sleep is super important for the type of job I have which involves a LOT of alertness, the ability to concentrate and remember details, react quickly to crisis situations where my company's buisiness is impacted in a way where SLA's are going to be missed, people disappointed, and late delivery could mean anything from a disappointed customer to a genuine life and death matter.  My advice for better sleep if you're in a situation like mine would be to make sure you have about six (or perhaps even more?) hours to rest, use the rest room before retiring to bed. try one pill and go up it to two if that works for you, and enjoy a MUCH BETTER experience both sleeping and when you wake up.  I've been using these for about a week now, and they've really made a HUGE difference in my life. I don't see this produce as a \"drug\".  Natural foods like turkey contain Melatonin.

Most are in lower doses and that just doesn't work for me. Also, the other products feel like an undissolved pill in the stomached....who wants to drink 8oz of water right before going to bed.

Although I continued to only wake up for a short time after initially falling asleep, I felt groggy and somewhat disoriented the next morning.  At that point, I quit taking the tablets and tried some different methods for staying asleep from the University of Maryland's sleep website.  This included stopping all activities such as watching television at least one hour before bed time in order to do light reading such as a novel.  However, I did not use a tablet as usual but instead used a non-backlit e-reader.  I used a Kindle but probably any non-backlit e-reader will do.  I still sleep about the same amount of time but it is much improved with about 3/4 of my sleep being sound sleep as measured by my UP24.

I am a graduate student, so this is not that ridiculous, but I did not want to make this a habit. My doctor suggested I take melatonin. I compared a bunch of reviews on Amazon and decided to try this brand. I am very glad I did. The first time I tried it, I took half of a pill (1.5mg) around 11pm. (My doctor suggested I start off with 1mg one hour before going to bed, and if that did not work within the hour, to take another 1mg, and continue this process until I fell asleep). That night, I actually fell asleep at midnight and woke up around 9-10am. For me, this was a dramatic improvement over my previous sleep habits. What really surprised was that when I woke up, I felt refreshed. I didn't feel like I wanted/needed to stay in bed longer and I was less tired in the mornings. What I liked about this formulation is that it is sublingual, which means unlike other pills that you swallow with water, your body metabolizes less of it and you get the full effect of the melatonin. I also liked the fact that when I read the packaging, it is 99.5% pure melatonin, which means, I am not getting any kind of \"filler\" or additional supplement that I may already be taking via my daily multivitamin.

If you've ever taken Benadryl, you know the type of drowsiness that the pills induce before you fall asleep - these melatonin pills don't really have that effect, at least on me, and it seems that you just feel naturally sleepy right before you fall asleep. Also, the diphenhydramine sleep aid always leaves me extremely groggy in the morning, probably due to their anticholinergic [side] effects (e.g., dry mouth, grogginess, etc.), but the melatonin has not made me feel sluggish in the morning at all. I feel well rested upon waking, and I will continue to take these pills at 1.5mg. These are great!

If you've ever taken Benadryl, you know the type of drowsiness that the pills induce before you fall asleep - these melatonin pills don't really have that effect, at least on me, and it seems that you just feel naturally sleepy right before you fall asleep. Also, the diphenhydramine sleep aid always leaves me extremely groggy in the morning, probably due to their anticholinergic [side] effects (e.g., dry mouth, grogginess, etc.), but the melatonin has not made me feel sluggish in the morning at all. I feel well rested upon waking, and I will continue to take these pills at 1.5mg. These are great! Keep in mind that the recommended dose for sleep disturbances is 0.3mg to 3mg, and studies have shown that melatonin has very little side effects with up to 3 months of use.

Anyway, 1 pill makes her actually want to get in bed and she's out within a half hour at most.  We can actually SEE it working within 10-15 mins, complete change in her energetic state.  Even a half pill seems sufficient to make her want to get in her own bed.  I don't want to give it to her all the time and it does not keep her asleep the whole night, typically she only sleeps for 4 hours before waking and having to put her back in bed.

She went through a 2 year period where she had trouble falling asleep at home and an absolute struggle if she went on a sleepover. We halted sleepovers for about a year and tried therapy which helped some. In the end though, I think she is simply a more anxious child and sleep can be an issue if she is worried about something or feeling uncomfortable with a situation. As she got older, she was able to calm herself more. A friend with a child with ADHD recommended melatonin. I checked with the pediatrician who said it was fine. This product tastes so much better than anything we bought in the drugstore. Also it's only 1mg which was plenty for her.

Just like the stories I've read on here, it sometimes takes more than 2 hours to finally get her to stay in bed.  The result of not having restful sleep has also affected her mood during the day.  She gets very irritable and easily throws bad temper tantrums when she does not get her way.  We mentioned these problems with her pediatrician and we were told to try an over-the-counter sleep aid that is at least 1mg melatonin.  I searched on Amazon right away and this was one of the first ones that I saw right away.  I called the doc's office to make sure this brand is safe and they gave the green light for it.  It's only been a week since we started giving her this supplement, but we have seen a dramatic difference.  Our daughter has been in a good mood most of the time, especially when she wakes up in the morning.  She gets up all refreshed and starts talking a lot about how excited she is with school, etc...  I could bring her to the grocery store after school and not get a temper tantrum from her when I tell her no whenever she asks for a candy or some snack.  Best of all, when we tell her it's bedtime, she does not give a fuss and heads to bed right away.  I usually give this to her right after dinner, so as soon as she gets out of the shower, she's already ready for bed.  The past three nights, she's been waiting in bed for us as soon as we say it's bedtime.  I didn't know why we waited so long to tell the doctor about her problems.

I can let the SleepWell gummies dissolve in my mouth instead of having to chew them up.

Today I read from Dr. Mercola's article that Pepsi's switch from NutraSweet (aspartame) to Splenda (sucralose) is not much improvement. Sucralose is associated with many of the same adverse effects as aspartame, including respiratory difficulties, migraines/headaches, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, heart palpitations and weight gain.
