I laid there in bed all night feeling happy and thinking too much. I started taking it in the morning.

I don't think that this product would work for severe depression. There is online research for this herbal product but research to date has only been conducted in other countries. There was a doctor on Dr. OZ that shared that they give it to patients who suffer with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I read in some of the research that there are other healing properties to this supplement as well. I like it and will continue to take it. The rest is up to you to decide for yourself.

I couldn't sleep at night and it kept me up for several days! I was so energetic! It's function is to combine the oxygen with your blood so fast that cost much less oxygen as usual. When you are under stress or have respiratory problem you are taking less oxygen. Then this kind of adaptogen helps a lot! And then I reduced the amount of intake. I used a 10 mg micro spoon to take 100mg every morning before 7am. Then it stopped bothering my sleep while giving me a lot of energy! It's a great energy booster! Even better with Co Q 10 capsule.

After 3-4 days I could definitely tell the difference in my mood and general well being. After one week I increased the dose to two capsules in the morning and the unexpected happened. By 6pm I couldn't keep my eyes open! I was so extremely sleepy, I would take 2-3 hour nap. I was pretty much screwed up. Going to bed at a reasonable time after such a long nap was not going to happen. Immediately I decided to decrease the dose to one capsule. I read somewhere that Rhodiola has sedating effect in higher doses while in low doses acts as a stimulant. My experience seems to confirm the higher dose effect since within days my afternoon sleepiness just went away without decreasing all the other positive changes I initially noticed. I wish this herb was more popular. I wish it was mandatory to take this before moving on to any pharmaceutical chemicals people are poisoned with with little to no improvement but tons of side effects.

The written, supplied material was helpful to me, I usually devour these materials quickly. I had also done evaluations of the literature, etc. on my own. I began the supplement after my spouse had seen something about the item and its impact on cortisol, stress, etc. So, I began the regimen. I will also continue to do so to impact my response to stress, I am a type A prototype.  What I have noticed quickly is an increased level of alertness, not a hyper response in any consideration. I just pay more attention to things for instance when I drive, signage, anticipating other drivers miscues, etc. I am also a sleep apnea patient who gets good relief via the CPAP machine, etc. My sleep hours are very good.

Since undergoing an allogenic stem cell transplant in 2009 (Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma), I have found that I tend to run out of steam in the early afternoon, requiring a marathon afternoon nap.  Since I have always been an active and outgoing person I, honestly, find it embarrassing to require a nap while others my age are out doing things.  It's just not me.  A few years ago my doctor prescribed Ritalin to restore my alertness and energy, but I understand that prolonged use results in negative issues and I want to avoid that.  I received my order of Supernova Naturals Rhodiola Rosea on Friday, May 22, 2015, and took my first dose early in the morning  of the next day, on Saturday.  Initially, I did not realize any difference in my energy level or overall well being and proceeded about my daily chores and errands.  Funny thing, though, as I was preparing for my usual afternoon nap, it suddenly struck me that I was not tired in the least, certainly, not tired enough for a nap.  It was a revelation that, perhaps, there might just be something to this Rhodiola stuff.  Today was day two of my Rhodiola Rosea experience and, again, I took it about 6:30 am, along with some other supplements.  Since it is Sunday, I proceeded to Sunday School and Church.  Sunday School begins at 9:30 am, and Church begins at 10:45 am.  Usually, by 11:15 or 11:20, during the church service, I am spent and begin nodding off.  My desire to nap at that time is usually overwhelming and requires a good dose of Ritalin and constant prodding from my wife to maintain my alertness.  Today, however, I decided to forgo my dose of Ritalin to see if the Rhodiola Rosea would help me remain alert and active.  Guess what? \u2026.. I made it through the entire service wide awake, without the side effects generally experienced with Ritalin!  Yes, I am impressed!  At this point, I am very optimistic regarding the effectiveness of Rhodiola Rosea and, especially, the Supernova Naturals product.  While I haven't noticed any reduction in stress issues, really, I think it is too early for that assessment \u2026 but the immediate benefit of restored alertness and energy is certainly evident.

I am a pharmacist and professor and have studied patient outcomes, adverse drug events, and patient compliance with regimens for decades. So needless to say, I have taken the Rhodiola Rosea daily from a compliance standpoint. The informative data you sent right away was very helpful. Whenever I or anyone that I study takes a new drug, I am always interested in immediate and continuing effects. The written, supplied material was helpful to me, I usually devour these materials quickly. I had also done evaluations of the literature, etc. on my own. I began the supplement after my spouse had seen something about the item and its impact on cortisol, stress, etc. So, I began the regimen. I will also continue to do so to impact my response to stress, I am a type A prototype.  What I have noticed quickly is an increased level of alertness, not a hyper response in any consideration. I just pay more attention to things for instance when I drive, signage, anticipating other drivers miscues, etc. I am also a sleep apnea patient who gets good relief via the CPAP machine, etc. My sleep hours are very good. But I am really attentive to potential problems with lack of attention to cues of any sort. Driving is probably most important to me.

While I have received benefits from all brands, I think Supernova Naturals has been the most effective. I began taking Rhodiola Rosea while taking college courses online. I had anxiety taking timed tests, and it helped me to calm down enough to focus on the test rather than the timer. I saw almost immediate results in my mood and concentration levels in my day-to-day tasks. I am able to focus much better at work (very demanding computer work and research), and I do not feel so tired in the mornings after taking a capsule. I usually stop taking it after a month, and in about another month I notice that I am losing concentration and getting anxiety/irritation at work. Once I start taking it again, it's like night and day. I feel great, and I always wonder why I quite for the month between. My only issue with Rhodiola Rosea is it causes me to wake up at night and feel awake when I need to sleep. So I can only take it in the morning. I am not sure, but I think it has been helping my cortisol levels since I am feeling more calm and relaxed. Cortisol is a big reason a lot of us gain weight. I am hoping the supplement will aide in some way while I am losing weight.\u00a0", "title": "Quality Brand, Great Supplement", "rating": "5"}, {"helpful": 3, "body": "Thank you very much for your valuable interest in our comments about", "title": "He is 77 years old and looks like he finally recovered his youth energy", "rating": "5"}, {"helpful": 1, "body": "I take this before a workout or before I study!

I found myself being tired all the time and 100% dependent upon coffee so I started to research nutritional supplements and found this product.  In addition to working full time while pursuing my bachelors degree with a full course load I have two kids at home that keep me moving.  I'm not a herbal guy by any means and actually this is the only pill I take of any kind as I'm generally skeptical and sensitive to side effects of just about anything.  I must say that I've had no side effects from these, but what I have experienced has already caused me to purchase a second bottle.  I seem to calmer and think things through a bit more which is not originally why I ordered this supplement.  I wanted to cut back on my coffee intake and to have more energy throughout the day, the effect this supplement has can best be described as making me feel younger.  I actually feel more aware of things and am able to exercise longer and harder than I have before.  I track my workouts with a GPS app and heart rate monitor (mostly jogging) and found some interesting changes after taking this supplement.  My average heart rate has dropped consistently during my workouts and I've found that I feel more motivated to exercise harder.  Not only do I feel better but my workout data reflects the way I've been feeling.  I can't say that this product has performed any miracles, but I generally feel more energetic and have seen no side effects.  To me this is substantial enough to continue ordering them.  I've also noticed that some of the little things that used to irritate me at work don't seem to get to me as often anymore.  I generally don't take the time to write these kind of reviews but this product is worth a try.  Coincidently I never did reduce my coffee intake but I haven't increased it either and I've just generally been feeling a lot better overall since I've been taking these.  The most profound effect seems to be the mood enhancement that comes from taking these, I seem to have a more positive outlook overall.", "title": "Supplement that actually makes a difference", "rating": "5"}, {"helpful": 1, "body": "These really work wonders.", "title": "Great purchase", "rating": "5"}, {"helpful": 0, "body": "This product make me feel weird the day after taking it.  will not buy again.", "title": "One Star", "rating": "1"}, {"helpful": 1, "body": "I started taking this a few weeks ago.

Started taking again and I noticed gradual improvement...not a MAJOR, direct sort of thing, but subtle.  Like sometimes I started to notice that I just really felt good in the moment.  Hard to describe.  I eventually upped my dosage to 300 mg/day as the 100 mg did not seem to be doing it for me anymore.  As someone noted in their review, you do not take a capsule and suddenly feel euphoria!!...it takes 2-3 weeks of consistently taking it on an empty stomach, first thing in morning is best.  One thing that was an interesting side effect, at least for me, and apparently not too uncommon, is that I started having caffeine headaches from drinking coffee.  Rhodiola reportedly can accentuate the impact of caffeine on your system, so beware, be on the lookout if you suddenly start having headaches so you know why you are getting them.  I switched to white peony tea and feel better...white tea has enormous benefits for health as well.  Finally, I would note that New Chapter's product seems to stand heads above the other brands out there...I have tried several and did not feel as good.
