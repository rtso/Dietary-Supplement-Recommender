[{"helpful": 1, "title": "Appears to fade Melasma", "body": "I had read an article that Grape Seed Extract may help fade melasma.  I've had melasma on my face, brown patches on my forehead and cheeks, for over 15 years. I never leave the house without make-up/foundation.  I've tried various hydroquinone fade creams, Retin A and other products attempting to get rid of the brown patches on my face (I have fair to medium skin).  I use high SPF sunscreen religiously every day, winter and summer, but the brown patches still appear, and are always darker in the summer.  I purchased this Grape Seed Extract at the beginning of the summer in hopes that it might help.  I've been taking two capsules per day, for the past 5 months or so.  At first I noticed that the brown patches didn't darken as they normally would during the summer. Eventually the melasma patches became paler, now the patches are the palest they have ever been in 15 years, much closer to my skin color.  I can use much less make-up/foundation to even out the look of my skin.  The only difference in my usual skin care routine has been taking two of these Grape Seed Extract capules every day for the past 5 months, I've gone through several bottles.  I am quite convinced that my significantly improved skin tone is likely a result of taking the Grape Seen Extract.  I've never written an Amazon review before, but I felt compelled to share my experience with fellow melasma sufferers.", "rating": "5"}, {"helpful": 7, "title": "Potent product", "body": "I am usually a skeptic when it comes to supplements.

Drastic reduction in allergies and arthritis in my knees", "body": "I started taking this product just because I had heard about the science behind it and some phenomenal benefits to general health \u2013 balancing out blood sugar, protecting the cardiovascular system, possible cancer prevention etc. I was not really expecting to notice anything, nevertheless the almost immediate benefits that I got. After I started taking this product within a week or so I noticed my knees were feeling better then they literally had in 5 years and I had a drastic reduction in my allergies. My allergies as a whole aren't that bad, especially because I take another supplement by Standard Process \"Attronex\" that prevents me from experiencing mild seasonal allergies\u2026 Which in Florida is most of the year. I highly recommend that product and a bottle will last you six months to a year depending on how you take it. After moving into another house last year I started having substantial allergies every morning. Anyways, at first I wasn't sure if The results were just a coincidence but after a few weeks when not only did that issues I was used to experiencing not come back but they continue to get better and better I was pretty sure it was this product. Months later I went on vacation and did not have this with me and within less than a week my knees felt absolutely horrible and I was experiencing substantial allergy symptoms too, thanks to my girlfriends cat. I was able to find a less potent version of the same supplement, also from the same Now brand while on vacation and paid way to much for it\u2026 But it was totally worth it! I also picked up some ginger, and this dried powdered form from the spice rack at the local grocery store, since this was another supplement I took for my knees but didn't have with me. Within less than two days of taking triple doses of the weak seed extract a couple times a day along with a tablespoon of ginger powder mixed in with some water (no it doesn't taste good thought I have done this every day for a couple years with either this or Tumerick) and I spent all day sightseeing the cliffs on the California ocean jumping from rock to rock and sightseeing in the mountains. Just two days earlier even going to the grocery store was killing my knees! were literally talking about around a 95% reduction in pain within a few days, while at the same time increasing a lot of activities that would definitely have  increased pain if I hadn't used these two supplements. Most hard-core narcotic medications can't even compete with that, plus the supplements arguing a bunch of good things for the mind and body, instead of having side effects and negatively affecting a persons health. Ginger is A really good supplement for joint pain, and a ton of other things, but I only get a 50 to 70% reduction in joint pain and it normally takes 5 to 7 days for the maximum effect.  I highly recommend this product just for general health benefits, but if you have any issues with joint pain, arthritis or respiratory allergies then you definitely want to try this. I'm sure works for a lot of other things as well. It definitely reduces inflammation in the body, which is why it works so well for me and those two issues, so supplement should reduce or possibly a lemonade hundreds of different Health issues.

Because natural medicine takes longer, I knew to NOT expect overnight results.  In regards to the ADD, I noticed fairly quickly, that it worked about 70% as well as the prescription medicine -at a fraction of the cost- and that was good enough for me to continue.  However, after several months of taking it, I noticed that I was not catching any of the usual, winter, upper-respiratory infections.  What's significant about that, is that every winter, at least three times, I'll come down with something and need antibiotics, and even asthma medication and this is the first winter I have not had to deal with any of it.  I've come down with a couple of very mild colds that lasted only 3 days.  No bronchitis, no sinus infections, nothing else.
