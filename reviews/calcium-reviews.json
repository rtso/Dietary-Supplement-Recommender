If you get a different color, like dark ivory or yellow, I would return it. It may not be perfect for everyone but it works great for us.  I buy it for one of my sons who has a number of food allergies, including dairy, soy, and nuts, as well as a gluten sensitivity, for whom it was really hard to find a regular source of calcium without loading him up with rice milk.  I started him on this calcium supplement around age 2 years old, with just a few drops from a dropper until he got used to the taste, and now he drinks a little bit of it (about 1 TBSP), using a plastic medicine cup (like the kind that comes for free on top of a bottle of liquid Children's Tylenol or Advil) after his meal and if he doesn't get it he makes sure to ask for it, because to him it tastes like a treat (he literally says, \"mmm, yummy calcium!\").
