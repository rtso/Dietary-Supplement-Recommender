About once or twice a year the Dr gives my body a break from the aggressive antibiotic therapy, but my immune system is completely shot. I full heartedly swear by this stuff. Even while on antibiotics I sometimes get sick if it's not bacterial, or when I'm on break I ALWAYS get sick. When I start to feel a little more under the weather than usual, I bring out my echinacea 1 pill twice a day for a week and it works miracles. Sometimes I even empty the capsules to make a tea with some local honey I was lucky to find someone sold right here in the middle of the city.

The \"now\" product uses the root which is much harder to find when you check the ingredient list on other manufacturers.  I believe this is why many people do no see the results one hopes for when using Echinacea.  This product has been the best I've used and the cost to benefit ratio can't be beat, in my estimation. \"Now\" also makes a \"Dry E\" which is Tocopheryl Succinate, another hard to find product whose benefits are backed by quite a bit of research.

I shop at Whole Foods and they are liberal with their return policy, which is good because I went through about 6 kinds of \"kids\" vitamins, all of which were rejected by my children.  Finally, I brought home the Yummi Bears and the problem was solved. It's not hard to get them to eat 3 vitamins because they are like candy for them. The only problem was the cost...Whole Foods sells them for something north of $20. So, finding that I can buy them on Amazon (and I've got the free shipping option) saves me a bundle.  With 3 kids and 3 vitamins each, we go through a bottle every three weeks!
