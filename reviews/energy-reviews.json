So, after a grueling night with the baby, a newborn, I saw one of these at the local gas station and decided to give it a try.  I will say, while not a homerun when it comes to taste, it wasnt bad.  That could be, though, because there isnt that much liquid to swallow, so the taste is a one time deal unlike with larger energy drinks.  The grape was not horrible.  Nor my preferred drink taste, but tolerable.  I will say this, their advertisements were pretty dead on.  It provided me an alert feeling with little to no jitters.  I was more awake and felt better suited for the day than I would have felt had I not taken the shot.  Also, I didnt feel a big crash when it wore off, more like a cooling of my body.  I will say this, I do not take one of these every day.  It is about a once every week or two thing for me, depending on how the baby slept. So, that is probably why it worked so well for me.  As with anything, if you take too much of it, your body will get used to it, and it will have a different effect.

Normal energy drinks over the years have really lost their effect on me, and in turn I'd had to resort to drinking more and more to feel energized. The energy shots like 5hr, etc never gave me a rush, they just usually made me feel hot, flush and at times dizzy. These Redlines, though, perk me way up and do it within 10 minutes. For most you really shouldn't drink more than the half bottle that's recommended. Even on that half bottle I feel more energy and stay \"up\" longer than with anything else. I also don't feel a crash, as there's no sugar.", "title": "Best Energy Drink"}, {"rating": "5", "helpful": 5, "body": "This product has been one of the best 'energy drinks' i've had.

At first, it tasted like chalk. But the more I considered the taste, I found a better comparison. If you crushed several Tylenol tablets and swallowed the powder in a dry mouth, you'd get the same after as the Mio's aftertaste. YUCK!
