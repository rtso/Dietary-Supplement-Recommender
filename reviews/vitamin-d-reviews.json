It works better than oral ingestion, it increases blood levels steadily, without digestive hindrances, and with little absorption competition. I could tell mostly because my d levels are on the high side, and i tend to have hypercalcemia. Which by the way can be controlled with vitamin A retinol food intake. Since i take daily minimum of 2-3 k of vitamin d, i rubbed 2k of it into my forearms. Let me just say that it was too much. I developed a strong headache, though not the usual kidney discomfort i get. But after i control how much calcium i take, i feel well and very alert. One down side is that i noticed less bone mineralization i normally achieve, and my only explanation for this is that the transdermally taken vitamin d must have oxidized the majority of the vitamin A retinol from the bloodstream. Whenever i take vitamin A as retinol PLUS sufficient vitamin D together orally, i can feel the remineralization in my teeth. Normally during winter i feel miserable when taking vitamin A as retinol in any form, food or supplement. But after the transdermal application of vitamin d, i had no such ill feelings when taking vitamin A, which makes me wonder how much of it actually remained active. When exposed to the sun, the body makes just enough.

Other than eating small bony fish, there are not too many ways to get enough Vitamin D especially living up north where there is limited amounts of sunlight, particularly in the winter.  I am a vegan, and not surprised that my vitamin D levels are low. When the vitamin D levels are so low, it effects my LDL (low density cholesterol) and raises it.

However, after I stopped taking the high dose, my doctor recommended 2,000 IU per day. I bought 4 different brands in health food store, best quality I could find/perceive, but started having jittery results, palpitations, etc.  It turns out that after having been on high dose for three months, then my levels plummeted and started major symptoms (withdrawals?) with feelings of depression, bone pain, and, the worse symptom, unable to sleep due to major palpitations.  After ER visits, cardiac monitors (all in a great effort to address the symptoms and not the root cause), a different doctor suggested Vit D 5000 IU by Thorne daily.  After three days of taking them, I started to feel like I had not felt for years.  No side effects, in fact, these pills provided a very calming effect vs the jittery effects from the other ones.  Regarding cost:  Thorne is priced similarly to health food store brands, and they work.  Also, if you are a woman in the early 50s, and you are not feeling yourself, have your Vitamin D levels checked. If low, take these vs all the other major drugs some doctors are so quick to prescribe.  You'll feel a million times better without taking drugs that eventually will provide other/new side effects.
