Had decided to eat sardines for breakfast for a change.  By day 4 of this routine I noticed my heart arrhythmias, which had been a constant in my life for a few years, had mysteriously trailed off to almost none.  Curious and pleased I searched online to find if there was anything in sardines or fish that affected heart rhythm, and the amino acid Taurine popped up...apparently fish is a rich source of Taurine.  So I continued with fish for breakfast, alternating with canned chub mackerel and canned Alaska salmon, and I began supplementing with Taurine, such as this product by NOW.  I also found info online indicating that hospitals sometimes employ Taurine to counter irregular heart rhythm.  I have had a pacemaker for 3 years, but it did not affect episodes of afibrillation or PVCs...but it does keep a record of such events.  In the spring of 2015 my pacemaker was \"interrogated\" at the doctor's office and reported 6,600 instances of irregular heartbeat...a year later in May of 2016 the interrogation reported only 33!  I'm thankful to God for the improvement.  Interestingly, my doctor never suggested Taurine and made no comment when I mentioned what a help it is...except that she added Taurine to the list of supplements taken \"as reported by the patient\".  If it sparked a flicker of interest on her part, I could not tell.

The taurine is a fine white, crystalline powder.  I disagree with previous reviews regarding taurine and beta alanine supplementation but they are correct in their information.  Yes, it is true that taurine and beta alanine do use the same transport and if one is consumed in orders or magnitude greater than the other, the one in higher concentration will out compete the other (to be more scientific, it depends on the binding [Kd] constant of the two).  To make it simple, if both are taken in similar concentrations there really should not be an issue (if the Kds are the same).  If taken alone (beta alanine), then I would suggest supplementation with taurine because the amount your are supplementing will simply out compete any taurine in the foods you get.  If you do have some concern about taking them together, you can always just take the taurine at night or separately from the beta alanine.

Superior product in both quality and purity.  The taurine is a fine white, crystalline powder.  I disagree with previous reviews regarding taurine and beta alanine supplementation but they are correct in their information.  Yes, it is true that taurine and beta alanine do use the same transport and if one is consumed in orders or magnitude greater than the other, the one in higher concentration will out compete the other (to be more scientific, it depends on the binding [Kd] constant of the two).  To make it simple, if both are taken in similar concentrations there really should not be an issue (if the Kds are the same).  If taken alone (beta alanine), then I would suggest supplementation with taurine because the amount your are supplementing will simply out compete any taurine in the foods you get.  If you do have some concern about taking them together, you can always just take the taurine at night or separately from the beta alanine.

I don't know whether it works for that, but I know something even more valuable. My husband has atrial fibrillation and he didn't like taking beta blockers for it - they made him very tired. A vegan physician in Portland told him to stop taking the beta blocker and take this brand of taurine instead. He told us a drug company did some studies using taurine for a-fib and they found it worked. Since taurine is a natural product, it couldn't be patented. So the company tried making small modifications to it, but with every change they made, the modified taurine either no longer worked or it had harmful side effects. Since the drug company couldn't get rich selling the natural product, they abandoned their research and moved on. My husband found it worked great to suppress his a-fib. He takes 2000 mg per day. Once we ran out of this product and just bought some taurine at Whole Foods, and another bottle (different brand) at our local health food store. In 3 days, his a-fib came back! We realized we had to get back to this brand, and we found it on Amazon. My husband is fine now. We will stay with Pure Encapsulations because it seems to be the highest quality. By the way, the doctor told us that taurine works for about 80% of people with a-fib. If a-fib comes back, he said to increase the dose to 3000 mg per day. The best part is, there are no side effects! And no, I have absolutely no commercial link with this product, but my husband is a very happy customer.

Therefore reducing symptoms of my chest pains and slows down my tachycardia some too, although it mainly is great for lowering blood pressure numbers. I put my parents and sister on this as well , because it works, and who wants to constantly run to the doctor every time it goes up, when there is something you can do for yourself at home that is safe in my own opinion, and is natural too, not a harmful side effect drug, from a nasty greedy noncaring pharmauceutical company. Be sure to discuss your own kind of health problems and fears or concerns with your own doctor though, especially if you are afraid of your symptoms you are having. I just don't want an increase in my prescription high blood pressure, or be given another drug of same class or kind on top of what I am already taking, side effects of mixing prescription meds are highly toxic and bad for us and must be watched carefully. One good side effect of taking 1,000mg.  jarrow formula taurine, is you will be more alert and aware of things around you, it kind of perks you up. Everybody needs and wants to be more alert in life, right? Now beware however if you already have low blood pressure, don't take this, it may lower yours down too much, which can cause you to pass out or feel faint, or dizzy. You must first check your own blood pressure at home with blood pressure cuff to know if you need to be taking Taurine or not. If after you take your own blood pressure if shows or tells you that you are within normal limits, don't take Taurine. If yours is low, don't take Taurine. Only take Taurine if you need it, if your blood pressure measuring device cuff says that you are within high range, then it is safe to take one capsule of taurine to bring it back down to normal number once again. Ask you own doctor if it is okay to do this. Research this subject on your own as well, learn what to do and not to do. Homeopathic doctors, and some D.O.  have a more opened mind on natural alternative supplements and treatments than regular MD's do. You do what is best for your own body, you may need to find a new doctor with a more open mind on natural methods in improving your health, because most doctors are not educated enough on this subject of herbs and supplements, etc....Some will even put you down for trying other things besides what they prescribe for you to take or do.
