Some of the symptoms that this product helped alleviate for me were difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and slightly elevated blood pressure (not high enough to need medication but elevated for me).

It turns out that these particular magnesium got an overall \"A\" for high quality, and the previous ones I was taking (Source Naturals Ultra-Mag) earned a \"B\" rating. Not too bad either; but the Source Naturals Ultra-Mag were very difficult to swallow. These are much better AND I can ACTUALLY tell the difference between the two brands! It has helped me tremendously with headaches and occasional constipation. I take one capsule before bedtime and I am able to fall asleep quickly and soundly.

It's not a miracle pill but you will see improvement in your level of pain especially nerve pain. And it does have so many other benifits. It does not cause me to be sleepy at all but I have insomnia but 2 before bed does help my husband fall asleep quickly so I guess it effects everyone different and I'd try justvone at a time if your taking during the day.

I also have to admit that besides using this product, my DW has been using magnesium oil/lotion before going to bed just to make sure enough magnesium is absorbed into where it needs the most so that may also play a role in fixing the problem.

I could take that only at night on an empty stomach or I would have the same problems as the magnesium oxide, but usually on a bit more of a time delay. And I found I couldn't take the full dose of that either (1 pill = 200mg, so 2 pills is a full dose).  Turns out that version is buffered.  I didn't know the difference until I read some reviews here, but if buffered means that it's mixed with I guess magnesium oxide.  Not sure, because it doesn't say on the label.

The absorption rate is double that of Magnesium oxide which my pharmacist confirmed this information for me. Most adults do not receive the daily required amount of Magnesium in their diet everyday. You need at least 400 mg of Magnesium to keep your body happy & functioning properly! It gives every area of your body this necessary nutrient for maximum functioning! Bluebonnet is an exceptional company that makes superior products! I highly recommend the addition of one of these tablets daily! I break one tablet in two & take  half in the AM at breakfast & the other half in the PM at dinner for a constant supply of this necessary nutrient in my body! The best part is to take Bluebonnet Magnesium Citrate along Citracal as these nutrients work in harmony with each other! I also add in Jarrow Formulas's Hyaluronic Acid 50mg AM & PM as this supplement strengthens your joints & hydrates your skin! THINK in terms of you FACE & wrinkles as it with these other nutrients supports regeneration in so many areas of your body! Then lastly add in Bluebonnet Vitamin D3 at least 800mg AM & PM since we are now in winter when you are less likely to have exposure to the Sun! This combination of nutrients I have found creates perfect harmony & synergy! Hope Amazon posts this review so that others can benefit from my research! To get back to the Bluebonnet Magnesium Citrate it is the only magnesium in the marketplace I would ever purchase! To your excellent health! Yesterday I forgot another essential Vitamin that is necessary for the synergy & effortless absorption of this grouping of nutrients & that is Vitamin C by Vita Logic Bio_C 1000 which has Quercetin & essential bioflavanoids & is sold on Amazon. I break one of these in half & take it with the other nutrients AM & PM with Breakfast & Dinner. This vitamin tablet is scored & breaks easily apart. I have found this to be the best Vitamin C product on the market. This combination of nutrients, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Citracal(calcium), Vitamin D3, & Magnesium Citrate keep me pain free & youthful in appearance so much so that when I request the senior's discount I am viewed with disbelief. I actually had one cashier after showing my driver's license to prove my age, state that it is easy enough to get a FAKE ID! Go figure!! I  just laughed & smiled!!!

This product helped me to bring the blood magnesium up to a higher level.

I had to discontinue the Omeprazole and the low dose aspirin so will discontinue this product when my Magnesium levels are normal long term. No one should ever take low dose aspirin without a doctor's advice and unless it is absolutely necessary, as acid stomach side effect is a big problem.

If you don't get it positioned perfectly straight at the back of your throat and it happens to turn to one side or the other while going down, you'll either get an unpleasant scraping feel on the inside of your throat or worse yet, it'll feel like it's getting stuck and then you have to gulp some additional liquid to wash it the rest of the way down.  Bad shape!  If it were more rounded like a football that would help a lot.  What makes it even worse is that you have to take 4 of these puppies a day to get 100% of the RDA.  I'm sure the width of someone's throat will determine how easy this goes down.  Maybe some people have wide gullets and this complaint would appear to be silly, but if you're like me and horse pills present a problem, I'm fully confident that at some time or other this thing will scare the heck out of you when you think it has become stuck in your throat.

And periods of depression as well.  I have had very bad experiences with prescription meds.  I turned to trying supplements but honestly things like b12 did absolutely nothing for me. I noticed no difference.  My mom had been mentioning magnesium to me probably for over a year and I just kind of brushed it off for awhile thinking it wouldn't make any difference either. But in a very acute spell of anxiety/depression in December 2014 and I was willing to try anything.  I started with natural calm but gave me very bad tummy issues. I can't swallow anything bigger than an iburpofren so mag glycinate wasn't working that good either as I was having to crush up the pills. But mind you I was absolutely seeing a difference in my mood and anxiety levels even taking glycinate and citrate. But I saw this product and was excited by it being liquid. I started taking this mag in May 2015 and in a month I started to have a clarity and brightnes.  I can remember saying over and over my God- life feels good again.  I truly thank God everyday for sending this to me.  My quality of life has changed so dramatically taking this product.  In a good day before starting magnesium I would say my anxiety was maybe a 7 out of 10.  I would say it now is .5 out of 10.  The dosage I started on was one cap full in the morning. I honestly didn't care for it in the morning so started taking it at night before bed.  I think about 3 weeks after taking one cap full I upped it to 2 cap fulls each night. Now I do 2 cap fulls each night and one in the morning.  I also supplement with magnesium lotion from lifeflo each night only maybe a dime sized amount on my hands and chest and a little on my neck where I tend to have a lot of tension.  I do mix my good state mag with orange juice when I take it maybe 3 parts orange juice to 1 part mag. Its pretty nasty unless I do the orange juice which for the most part masks the taste.  I will plan to continue taking this product for as long as the Good Lord will allow me to.

With all my drama aside, I now feel good taking this supplement, not just emotionally but also physically. This makes my mind and my body happier than when I don't take it. The reason I purchased this type of mag is because it doesn't just collect in the bowels to be expelled diarrhea style without being absorbed. Every other mag I've tried does that to me and it's been thru trial and error and quite a few dollars wasted to find a mag that I can take without the that negative side effect. This is the mag I will continue to take. I belong to a FB page, Magnesium Advocacy Group. The owner of the page is so smart and had done so much research on how minerals work in our bodied.

I went to a Cardiologist, had the holter monitor (which did pick up the beats), but was ultimately told it was benign, and to 'learn to live with them'.  They attributed them to stress, but did not do any testing of mineral deficiencies to determine if they were being caused by an electrolyte or other nutritional imbalance.  I did a great deal of research on finding a cure for this situation (it is very hard to try to learn to live with something heart-related, it's very scary).  I tried increasing my potassium, which only helped a little, and had not considered magnesium as the problem.  I read countless info on how magnesium deficiencies can cause irregular heart beats, and then searched for the best form to take.  I tried Mag-Citrate, but it tore my stomach lining up (I have a sensitive stomach from having ulcers last year, so I have to be very careful about taking things that irritate it).  I also tried a very expensive brand of Mag Taurate, but did not like it much, and had not noticed a change in my situation entirely.  I read the Mag Glycinate was one of the best absorbed and most gentle magnesiums to take.  Originally I tried caplets, and they also hurt my stomach lining tremendously.  I found that capsules work best for me (I can open them and take a smaller amount that will not irritate my stomach).  This brand is the best magnesium brand I've tried. Solaray has been a very reliable brand with other supplements, so I gave them a try for my magnesium, and I'm glad I did.  I did find I cannot take the capsules whole because about 30 mins later it is a little hard for my sensitive stomach to handle (not terrible, but not great either), but when I open a capsule and take half with food, I have no problems.  It also has fixed the heart problem.  If I get an irregular beat now, it is rare, and not an ongoing problem the way it was.  It took about 1-2 weeks supplementing with this to fully correct the problem (it has also corrected my muscle twitches, which was another sign of mag-deficiency), and I am going to continue using these exclusively.  I know others did not like the fact that the capsules are only 100 mg each, but this is the best thing for me to keep from irritating my stomach lining (plus taking it in smaller increments keeps your body from wasting it, your body will only use what it needs and gets rid of the rest, so taking less at a time is more advisable, and mimics how we are actually supposed to be eating it in our diets)."}, {"rating": "5", "title": "Anxiety and Sleep Help", "helpful": 5, "body": "I have read a lot of information regarding the benefits of magnesium supplements on anxiety and insomnia, including reading the book, \"The Magnesium Miracle\".

If you are looking for something to help with anxiety, this is definitely not the right product. At least not for me. Be careful and really read and look up all ingredients before taking anything.

With other types of magnesium, I've reduced the frequency of my migraines from about 3 migraines most weeks to 1-2 migraines most weeks. The online research that I conducted had conflicting views as to which type of magnesium is most effective in helping with migraines, so I purchased Ultra-Mag because it is a blend of different types of magnesium (magnesium citrate, taurinate, malate, gycinate, and succinate according to the bottle) with addition B-6. Within a few weeks, I was only having about 3 migraines a month. My husband usually gets out the vitamins in the morning, and when our schedules changed and he began going in to work earlier, I was left to get my own vitamins, which I usually forgot. After about 5 days without the Ultra-Mag, I had one of the worst migraines I've had in years. Once I started up again, my migraines have again been reduced. I should also mention that I have found that I have the most benefit from the Ultra-Mag when I take it in conjunction with a calcium supplement. I take my calcium supplement every other day, as I read (and personally found) that too much calcium will cancel out the beneficial effects a magnesium supplement. I'm no medical personnel - I only relate this as my own personal experience.

So after reading reviews I decided to order some, even though many people cited the size of the pills made it impossible to swallow...well let me say they are the exact same size as the citrate I was taking - yes they are kinda big, but not out of the ordinary for a supplement.

To my surprise, it also almost completely eliminated heart palpitations. I talked with my doctors, while they thought the dose was a bit high, they were fine with it.

Then, more often than not, he would wake up a while later still in pain.  As he aged the headaches got more frequent, and when our pediatrician couldn't give us any treatments that actually worked, we found a pediatric headache specialist.  This Dr. believed in taking a preventative approach instead of waiting for the headache and treating it once the pain starts, so he prescribed (among other things) magnesium taurate twice a day.  The difference was like night and day--we couldn't believe it!!!  Since we have had my son on the preventative supplements, the headaches are rare occurrences, and we are able to get them under control before they get out of hand.  I did ask the Dr. why he chose this specific kind of magnesium, and he said that taurate has a much lower chance of causing stomach or digestive problems like loose bowels/diarrhea.

I was a bit cautious due to the fact that I suffer from a chronically inflamed sphincter and transient intensely painful rectal cavity itch. This was caused from years of horseback riding without a saddle. I wasn't sure if some of the ingredients in the product would throw my overly sensitive sphincter into 'overdrive'. But hearing my boss's glowing endorsement made me want to take a chance on the product. I took this for the first 2 weeks and really didn't notice much at all. During the 3rd week I noticed that my rectum started itching near bedtime. I also noticed that my sphincter became very hot to the touch each evening. The 4th week got even worse. My sphincter began 'sputtering' and the itching in and around my rectal cavity grew more intense. My pharmacist told me that this was just the product beginning to work and that my anal opening was getting cleansed. But I never told him about my chronic sphincter disorder and incessant rectal itch so he wasn't alarmed like I was. I thought I'd try a bit longer to see if my crevice would begin to heal. Midway through week 5, I woke up in the middle of the night almost screaming from the anal agony that my anus was going through. It felt like somebody had injected a pint of hot cayenne pepper extract deep into my rectal canal. The pain was excruciating and it felt like my sphincter was having convulsions. The only thing that gave me a bit of relief was when I began inserting ice cubes into my anal opening. I called a neighbor who fortunately drove me to the hospital. I told the doctor there about my lengthy history with anal, sphincter, rectal and crevice disorders and then I told him about this product. He told me to stop taking the product at once.

He said that he and his wife had been using it with great results. I was a bit cautious due to the fact that I suffer from a chronically inflamed sphincter and transient intensely painful rectal cavity itch. This was caused from years of horseback riding without a saddle. I wasn't sure if some of the ingredients in the product would throw my overly sensitive sphincter into 'overdrive'. But hearing my boss's glowing endorsement made me want to take a chance on the product. I took this for the first 2 weeks and really didn't notice much at all. During the 3rd week I noticed that my rectum started itching near bedtime. I also noticed that my sphincter became very hot to the touch each evening. The 4th week got even worse. My sphincter began 'sputtering' and the itching in and around my rectal cavity grew more intense. My pharmacist told me that this was just the product beginning to work and that my anal opening was getting cleansed. But I never told him about my chronic sphincter disorder and incessant rectal itch so he wasn't alarmed like I was. I thought I'd try a bit longer to see if my crevice would begin to heal. Midway through week 5, I woke up in the middle of the night almost screaming from the anal agony that my anus was going through. It felt like somebody had injected a pint of hot cayenne pepper extract deep into my rectal canal. The pain was excruciating and it felt like my sphincter was having convulsions. The only thing that gave me a bit of relief was when I began inserting ice cubes into my anal opening. I called a neighbor who fortunately drove me to the hospital. I told the doctor there about my lengthy history with anal, sphincter, rectal and crevice disorders and then I told him about this product. He told me to stop taking the product at once. After antibiotics and therapy sessions involving anal stimulation with lasers, my sphincter slowly stabilized and was once again cool-to-the-touch. I think the product may work fine for some folks but for those of us living with constant fecal and rectal spasms it is Buyer Beware!"}, {"rating": "1", "title": "I ordered this product for my husband and he has ...", "helpful": 0, "body": "I ordered this product for my husband and he has only used it a couple of days.

I built up to one ML doses 3-5 times a day, taken with juice or water. Occasionally I'll take a day or two off to avoid over-saturation. The past month or so I've decided to change my protocol, now I use one ML dropped beneath my tounge for maximum absorbtion into the blood stream. I hold it in my mouth for several minutes or longer then drink a few ounces of water. I do this after awaking and as many as five times a day. I recomend taking this with a high fiber diet and plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids. Flax seed/oil is choice, also coconut oil, raw celery, raw almonds help to metabolize magnesium.

It helped improved sleep.  I sometimes take extra for bouts of restless leg syndrome. Works within 30 minutes.  Even after 18 months at 400mg per night, my blood tests still show low magnesium.  With that being said, lately I have been trying almonds for migraines, since I have tried so many other things trying to avoid the prescription when possible.  I've noticed eating almonds or almond butter at the onset of symptoms have worked on occasion.  Wondering at that I researched the reason almonds work and it is due to high magnesium content.  So, I tried a full does of ionic magnesium (400mgs) at the onset of my next migraine.  Wow.  Without noticing it, my symptoms were slowly relieved over the course of an hour - I actually noticed after about 30 minutes that they were lessened.

The chelated tablets still cause diarrhea. I seriously need magnesium because I have experienced the great benefits from it, in spite of this side effect. It has taken away the palpitations, rapid heart beat, blood pressure issues, nervousness, soreness (even a massage hurts because of my sensitivity), flexibility and sleep. I have tried many, many things to help all these conditions, nothing has helped as much as magnesium. BUT....that side effect is not good because the diarrhea depletes the body of magnesium so the symptoms start coming back. With the Mega-Mag, I really can't see a big improvement of the symptoms, just some. But I did notice while taking the liquid that my hair is growing longer. That was a surprise. I still am taking it along with some of the chelated tablets, hoping that eventually it will start working without the tablets.  In the meantime, I am going to try angstrom magnesium. It should be here tomorrow. I also tried the ReMag but it made me feel weird.  They say that it might at first because that is how depleted the body is of magnesium. But I couldn't handle those weird feelings, it was really strange.  I hope that angstrom magnesium will take care of this. I have studied magnesium for now over a year, through books, Dr.'s and as much information I can find. I will be happy to be able to find some kind of mag. that works for me. I'm sorry that I only could give it 3 stars. I am not saying it doesn't work but I am not saying it does. For some people it might work great, for others nothing.

I threw it into the TRASH WHERE IT BELONGS.

Finally I found a brilliant doctor who guessed that I might have a Magnesium Deficiancy...I know, I'd never heard of it either. Well, he performed what I thought to be an extremely unusual (though incredibly helpful in diagnosing my ailment) test: He had me swallow this little device/detector thingie :-/ that fit inside a quickly dissolving gel capsule. Also inside the capsule was a thin string which was attached to the device (so he could later pull it right back out through my mouth when the test was done). I then drank something, I believe (it's been several years since the test, so I don't remember exactly) with magnesium in it. Soon after, I drank something with Baking Soda in it to see how fast my stomach could absorb/neutralize acid (again, it's hard to remember the exact things I drank). While the device was in my stomach, the doctor could see how well I absorbed Magnesium -- quite poorly, as he suspected. He also explained that if your body cannot properly absorb magnesium from foods, it can impact your ability to have bowel movements. Needless to say, this discovery has been a godsend! These pills work wonderfully. I do have to take 2 - 3 every other night though. I hope someone might read this review and discover a way to cure their constipation as well.

Then I sought out Consumerlab and this was one of the magnesium supplements that they tested and gave the green light to consume. So I bought it. I take this with a calcium/vitamin D supplement because it was recommended that people take a magnesium supplement in conjunction with a calcium/vitamin D supplement to aid in the calcium's absorption as well as to relieve some of the constipation that may be brought about by the calcium. So it's generally recommended that people consume 1 magnesium for every 2 calcium. I currently consume about 1050mg of calcium a day with about 600mg of magnesium. I haven't noticed any improvement in my bowel habits from taking this product, which is a little disappointing. But the main gripe that I have with this product is that it's a little difficult for me to swallow. I don't know how people swallow pills with such ease as though it comes naturally to them. With me that isn't the case. It's a little wide for me. I usually cut the pill in half and it's still difficult to swallow mainly because it still maintains its wide shape. I've tried cutting it into three different pieces, but aside from the rough jagged edges that form as a result of cutting the pill up, it's still difficult for me to swallow each piece. So I gave this product a decent three-star rating for the health benefits of taking magnesium, but everything from having no positive impact on my bowel habits along with the difficulty in physically swallowing this pill affected my ultimate sentiment/judgement about this supplement."}, {"rating": "5", "title": "Good price, good product", "helpful": 0, "body": "Good price, good product.

This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too."}, {"rating": "5", "title": "I don't want to be without it.", "helpful": 5, "body": "I am a 62 yr old woman with Celiac Disease. I have had a great deal of trouble sleeping - insomnia - and high levels of anxiety. I also have been plagued by foot and leg cramps. I had noticed, over the years, that often the insomnia and anxiety were \"Gut Related\". That if my gut was upset or \"under siege\" from something that I had consumed, that it was reflected in my mental state and I became hyper-vigilant. Hence the insomnia. I am sure you have heard that our gut is our \"Second Brain\" (if not, do a little research). I had Celiac for 13 years before anyone could figure out what the problem was (interestingly, it all began when they started to introduce GMO's into the food supply in the late 80's early 90's and started saturating wheat with Glysophate just before harvesting - which they are still doing - and we wonder why allergies and asthma and all sorts of autoimmune diseases have risen dramatically. But I digress.) So I was actually suffering from serious malnutrition due to my bodies inability to absorb nutrients. I have done enormous amounts of health related research for myself and knew that almost everyone was deficient in magnesium, especially \"women of a certain age\" and that it was a natural relaxant. I just couldn't deal with taking any of the available forms. Until I came across this - Natural Calm. All of the \"flavors\" are a bit strong, but when diluted in a full glass of half water, half orange juice, it goes down very nicely. Because of the reaction of the magnesium citrate to fluid (it foams up quickly) I just put a small amount of water in the bottom of a glass and and then add the powder. I stir it up and let it do it's foaming rise and calm down, then I add more liquid (sometimes I cut it with some juice). Many people say that you have to be careful about the amount that you use because it is a laxative. And that is true. But I don't have much of a problem with it, it actually works out well in my case, and I take a big heaping teaspoon of it every night (don't try that until you know how your body reacts! You might have to build up to that). I sleep soundly and am well rested, in a better humor (husband is grateful) and my cramping problem is greatly reduced. I have taken so many different supplements over the years, and tried so many different things and have not been impressed with much of it. But this is among a handful of products that actually works, and from which there are significant, measurable results.

I take this every night before bedtime.  This has an added awesome benefit.  Magnesium citrate is a wonderful laxative.  You can take it any time of the day, but I like the fact that taking it at night helps me to empty out in the morning.  Plus, it helps me to have several bowel movements throughout the day.  I can't tell you how much to take as you should regulate it according to your bowel tolerance.  I use it generously and sometimes go a little overboard.  Then, I cut back as I don't want to get diarrhea.  As one sage wisely noted, we are all dying of toxic bowel syndrome, and anything that you can do to keep that disgusting stuff moving out of the body is definitely worth having.  I am convinced that one of the reasons God created us with a need to defecate is to assist in keeping us humble.  Who doesn't battle with the sin of pride?  Yet, arrogance tends to receive a stern rebuke as one daily has to sit on the throne.  Having this product will increase the number of times you have to do that humbling task, but it will also greatly speed the endeavor.

First, I found what is called \"magnesium oil\" which is magnesium salt dissolved in water; it feels oily, hence the name. Applying the oil on my arm and shoulder gave me quite a bit of relief. My son tried it, and got tremendous relief from his restless leg. We have both been trying to use magnesium pills in place of the oil, and it works somewhat. But the combination of the oil, applied to the problem area, and the pills to get our magnesium levels up, seems to be the magic trick.

I typically would NEVER share this much information, but if someone else reads this, and it helps them, then it's worth the embarassment to me. This might be of particular interest to those who suffer from chronic constipation, severe pre menstrual cramps, or who are sluggish and foggy-minded. I have dealt with all of the above listed condiitions above to some degree or another, for the past few years. About me: I have had problems with regularity for quite some time now, off and on. Anyone who has dealt with this knows how miserable it can be. I try to eat all the right stuff, drink copious amounts of water, and cross my fingers. Because, sometimes I \"go,\" sometimes I don't, no matter how badly I need to. I've used herbal supplements, herbal teas and OTC treatments just to get some relief. I have had to forego pre-made plans with family and friends because I was just too miserable to leave the house, not only because of constipation, but also other times because of severe cramps due to PMS. I've researched all of the different things that someone can do to alleviate these issues, tried all of those things, and had read about Magnesium prior, I took Magnesium (-oxide) already, soooo...Well, in comes the 3rd symptom listed, \"Brain Fog.\" The magnesium that I read about, that is supposed to help with all of the symptoms that I have mentioned, was *less potent* from the form of magnesium I was taking daily (magnesium oxide). Apparantly, this *potency of Magnesium OXIDE I had been taking was much less effective.* When it finally dawned on me that I wasn't taking the *POTENCY\" of magnesium supplement that I thought I was, I ordered this *way more potent* Magnesium OXIDE thinking that if it helped any of my conditions, it would be worth the expense. At the top of my wish list for this supplement was to be able to \"go\" more regularly.

Oxide does the job and it's relatively cheap, which is why most multi-vitamins have it in that form.  We had searched for mag. citrate, but this popped up, and we didn't know exactly what form we were getting until it arrived. When it comes to magnesium, the citrate form is much more bio-available.  Users should also be aware that magnesium taken by itself can cause it to be deposited inappropriately in the body.  Traditionally, it's taken with calcium (preferably in citrate form as well) in a 2:1 ratio (twice as much calcium as magnesium).  The very latest research I've seen says that for maximum theraputic use, the ratio should be 1:1. Most people get plenty of calcium in their diet the rest of the time, so you won't need the 2:1 ratio at the time you take the magnesium, just the 1:1 for insurance. (You can even use a half tab of Tums.) BTW, among the many functions of magnesium is allowing muscles to relax, just as calcium is used to help muscles constrict or tighten.  As we have gotten older, we've had problems with muscles being too tight, and magnesium supplements help considerably, especially after chiropractor therapy.  It also helps the body use insulin effectively, and many people with Metabolic Syndrome find it helps lower BP as well as blood sugar. (Perhaps Metabolic Syndrome and adult-onset Type II diabetes can be linked to reduced levels of dietary magnesium, since deleted soils mean most food is lower in magnesium than used to be the case in the US.)  We find that taking magnesium about 30 minutes to an hour after dinner works well for us.  Some people experience a loosening of the bowels.  For most people, that's a good thing.  If you eat a high-fiber diet, magnesium helps draw water into the bowels so you may experience somewhat less urine being released although you'll continue to urinate about as frequently as before.  On the other hand, you may have bowel movements up to three times a day.  If bowels become too loose, you may not be getting enough bulk in your diet, or you may need to take less magnesium."}, {"rating": "1", "title": "It will color your teeth blackish.", "helpful": 2, "body": "Be warned, this turned my sister's teeth kind of blackish like she had been eating black licorice.
