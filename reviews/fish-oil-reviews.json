Omega-3s are \u201cessential\u201d fatty acids because the body can't produce them on their own and so we must rely on food & supplements. There are 3 types: ALA, DHA, EPA. Plant-based foods provide ALA, while seafood sources provide DHA & EPA. The positive health benefits of omega-3 are linked mostly with DHA and EPA. The American Heart Association recommends you get 1g of DHA+EPA per day. Hence the need for a fish oil supplement."}, {"title": "Personally, I think this is the best fish oil product out there.

The pills seemed a bit larger than another brand I've tried in the past.  I did experience the dreaded fish burp, but I'm not one that would discontinue use for that reason alone.  The fish burp wasn't that bad, just annoying.  However, after trying the pills, I experienced dreadful gastrointestinal problems.  Very bad case of diarrhea the first and second day.  This made me weak, frustrated, and not well for two days.  I'm giving the product a 4 rating because when I contacted the seller they were very prompt to respond.  While the product did not work for me, it may work for others.  We are all different.  Some of us more sensitivities than others.  Perhaps this particular product offered too much for my body, but I experienced GI problems after only taken the 1st dose.  I have taken other fish oil brands in the past that did not result in any GI issues, not sure what happened here.

You should know that not all supplements are the same. Some don't offer level of potency they claim to, and fish oil is fragile. If poorly handled during processing it could become contaminated, or oxidize. To sift through all of this since these are unregulated - look for third party certification specifically from IFOS. Viva passes all of their tests and this particular product is the most potent in their offering. It is well priced considering what is in each pill.

I ended up purchasing this fish oil because it offered more servings of high quality fish oil for a better price. After receiving the product I noticed some inconsistencies on the label. The label states that a serving is 2 capsules & that there is 90 servings per bottle. One would assume that the bottle would contain 180 capsules (90 servings x 2 capsules per serving), but instead the bottle has 90 softgels. Searching the bottle for more info, I found that the front of the bottle states \"90 capsules\". This leaves me confused - It is either 90 servings of 1 capsule or 45 servings of 2 capsules.

Rancid fish oil will leak through the styrofoam cup onto your counter.  We had 3-4 different types in the house and everyone other brand failed the test except this brand.

OmegaVia has a very aggressive, blog-like marketing team pushing this product on the Internet. If one searches \"enteric coated fish oil\" on Google, their website is the first to come up, listing all the benefits of enteric-coated fish oil, naturally. In fact, just searching any number of questions regarding fish oil will bring up Vin Kutty's blog on omegavia.com (the owner, always a bad sign). The \"health blog\" is just strangely written, vacillating between product placement and shooing contrary evidence (e.g. about the bioavailibliy of different forms of fish oil) under the rug. Check it out yourself. Enteric coating is almost certainly unnecessary for the absorption of fish oil in the human body (Lovaza, the actual fish oil-based pharmaceutical drug used for lowering triglycerides, is not even enteric coated!) save for a few potential exotic applications such as Crohn's Disease (and even these have marginal benefits). Do not be hoodwinked by marketing. It should be clear this is NOT the triglyceride form of fish oil, the most bioavailible form. This is the ethyl-ester (EE) form, a semi-synthetic form which is easier to manufacture (interestingly, it's the active ingredient in Lovaza as well, which raises all sorts of questions the FDA might be interested in investigating). DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PROFESSED HIGHER AMOUNTS OF EPA AND DHA. While technically yes there are higher \"amounts,\" this specific form (EE) is more poorly available to the body. This isn't intended to be a product plug, but most of Nordic Natural's stuff is triglyceride form, the primary reason they're so expensive. Bottom line: Don't waste your time with this stuff. They have excellent marketing, but the product is overpriced, less effective than the triglyceride form, and questionably legal due to their addition of an active pharmaceutical ingredient in accordance to the FDA's Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)."}, {"title": "1st to actually have a huge effect..", "helpful": 6, "rating": "5", "body": "Well for all the back & forth re which brand actually works, all I can say is this:"}, {"title": "Best fish oil by far!", "helpful": 5, "rating": "5", "body": "My rheumotologist suggested I research fish oil.

OmegaVia has a very aggressive, blog-like marketing team pushing this product on the Internet. If one searches \"enteric coated fish oil\" on Google, their website is the first to come up, listing all the benefits of enteric-coated fish oil, naturally. In fact, just searching any number of questions regarding fish oil will bring up Vin Kutty's blog on omegavia.com (the owner, always a bad sign). The \"health blog\" is just strangely written, vacillating between product placement and shooing contrary evidence (e.g. about the bioavailibliy of different forms of fish oil) under the rug. Check it out yourself. Enteric coating is almost certainly unnecessary for the absorption of fish oil in the human body (Lovaza, the actual fish oil-based pharmaceutical drug used for lowering triglycerides, is not even enteric coated!) save for a few potential exotic applications such as Crohn's Disease (and even these have marginal benefits). Do not be hoodwinked by marketing. It should be clear this is NOT the triglyceride form of fish oil, the most bioavailible form. This is the ethyl-ester (EE) form, a semi-synthetic form which is easier to manufacture (interestingly, it's the active ingredient in Lovaza as well, which raises all sorts of questions the FDA might be interested in investigating). DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PROFESSED HIGHER AMOUNTS OF EPA AND DHA. While technically yes there are higher \"amounts,\" this specific form (EE) is more poorly available to the body. This isn't intended to be a product plug, but most of Nordic Natural's stuff is triglyceride form, the primary reason they're so expensive. Bottom line: Don't waste your time with this stuff. They have excellent marketing, but the product is overpriced, less effective than the triglyceride form, and questionably legal due to their addition of an active pharmaceutical ingredient in accordance to the FDA's Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)."}, {"title": "Can get equal product from Swanson's for half the cost", "helpful": 1, "rating": "2", "body": "Can get equal amount or more of pharm grade omega 3 from Swanson's...just check label for products that have a greater or equal amount."}, {"title": "PLEASE  DO YOUR RESEARCH", "helpful": 0, "rating": "1", "body": "This is not for me!!!

The company refused to address this issue because it is \"outside 3 month sales date window\" but the product does not expire for two more years!!!!

The oxidation products then lead to cell death by compromising cellular membrane integrity or by damaging other proteins, lipids, or DNA.

However, my local Sam's Club stopped carrying these for some reason, so I was very relieved to find them available on Amazon.  I sure hope they are not discontinued, as this particular fish oil cap has one of the highest concentrations of omega 3's in 1 gel cap, at a good price that I found! I'm all for taking 1 pill whenever I can!  While research debates whether you should split up your omega 3's throughout the day versus taking all at once, I'm not very good at taking multiple doses.  It's got to be once or not at all! If you can handle swallowing what capsule size standards consider large - the gel cap measures 1 inch, then you got to try this one.  In one gel cap, you get 1400 mg of fish oil, but more importantly, it's the amount of Omega 3's in each pill that counts.  The higher the concentration level, the less fish oil you need to consume. This one contains 900 mg of Omega 3's, which is made up of 647 mg of EPA and 253 mg of DHA.  This is a concentration level of 64% (900/1400) which is ranked as a high concentration by ConsumerLab.com (very high being 65 - 79%).  Most other fish oil pills  require you to take 2 or 3 similar size pills to get the same amount of Omega 3's.  As noted on the label, 1 gel cap gives you triple the strength and is recommended for sedentary adults who do not consume fish on a weekly basis or are concerned with high blood pressure.  Again the research I've done conflicts on this, some saying 500 mg of Omega 3 is enough, others saying the average adult needs more like 900 - 1000 Omega 3's daily particularly if you have health concerns such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. I have both being treated with medication, but my doctor also advised taking a supplement since I don't eat fish regularly enough. I just started taking fish oil 3 months ago and haven't seen my doctor yet to see any measureable changes, but I feel great and I know there are many more benefits in consuming Omega 3's. This brand also uses an enteric capsule, which means it is designed to protect the soft gel from releasing the fish oil until it reaches the small intestine - hence no fishy burps!  In a 2015 updated review by ConsumerLab they approved this supplement in containing the amounts of EPA and DHA as claimed on their label, and passed the purity tests for lead and mercury. It also carries the USP verified symbol on its label.  There is a lot of information out there about fish oils, what to look for, what concentration is best, whether more EPA or DHA is better, etc. Fish oil supplements are by no means created equal.  Do your research, read the labels and know what you're getting.  Price is not an indicator, neither is the brand name.  As far as buying a fresh product online, the product I received last week had an expiration date of June 2016 and it was made in Canada.

I have multiple degrees, one in the sciences, but I am certainly no M.D., so don't follow my example on dosage without doing proper research and getting educated assistance.  But my point is, when you want to get 1800-2000mg in a day, fish oil caps become VERY expensive very quickly.  However after I crunched all the numbers, these pills won in cost-effectiveness against all the other brands when factoring in QUALITY of the oils along with cost per 1000mg Omega-3. In fact the only other company to compete was the Sams Club variety.  However the Life & Food brand edged them out because they contain a bit more O3's per serving :) I have been using them for 3 months now and I'm very happy! 1 serving first thing in the morning and one serving in the evening.

From what I've read, any fishy odor/taste indicates oxidation (spoilage).  Oxidation destroys the omega-3 fatty acids.  Hence you lose the healthful benefit of the fish oil pill.  Also, I read that fish oil capsules should be \"clear\" (like those clear shiny golden vitamin E or D capsules you buy).  I purchased this product twice, and both times the capsules have this \"hazy\"  semi-clear quality.  I compared this to another brand, which is perfectly clear ( and odorless as well ).  So while I like the quantity of EPA and DHA. in the Dr. Tobias capsules... what good is it if the main ingredient is damaged and potentially worthless?

Then, yesterday, I put the fish oil along with my other meds and left them in my pill dispenser. When I took it out in the night, I noticed bubbles inside the fish oil capsule. It was leaking and it had given a good coating of oil on my other meds also. I checked another bottle of the two I had bought and found that also seemed to have couple capsules that were leaking.

I also have a fair amount of stiffness too and after reading enough sources on the Internet, there appears to be some evidence that older people (that's me!) lack omega 3's and these fatty acids MAY help reduce inflammation and improve ones heart health.  Two for the price of one!!  There also does not appear to be a downside in taking modest amounts (now too  much of a good thing can also be a problem) of fish oil as long as the sources of the oil do not come from fish that are known to be contaminated with heavy metals like mercury.  In that regard, Dr. Tobias appears to have done his research - small fish and salmon are not on the list for now.  Like other reviewers have stated, I don't burp this fish oil.  I have added Nature's Made Cholest Off which has excellent reviews for reducing \"bad\" cholesterol and I imagine that one should not take both of these supplements at the same meal - the Cholest Off might prevent the absorption of the fish oil.

I'm just about 50, have been weight training, powerlifting, etc since i was a teenager, and a couple yrs ago, threw in some crossfit for good measure. I have taken this religiously, first thing in the am, and have an alarm set to take it again around 5 pm. I keep the bottle in the fridge, have noticed NO fish odor, fish burps, etc. Capsules are large, but very easy to swallow. I should also add that I added Dr Tobias hip knee and joint, along with some Flar-FX, a couple weeks ago. And I'm pleased to say I can definitely feel a difference. Body overall feels better, and knees are alot less stiff. I won't know about the bloodwork till next year, but anticipate great results there as well. As I mentioned, I DID receive a free bottle, but I wanted to write a straightforward, no BS review, and make it clear that I would give 5 stars without the free bottle."}, {"title": "I think this is a good product.

I decided to try omega 3 fish pills after reading studies that in some people, this supplement helped with Reynauds.

I just know it is these omegas that are reducing the pain to almost nothing, as if the injury almost didn't occur-it's still there in other words but so much less.

I do have a little more energy than I had before, but am not sure whether it is due to taking these fish oil pills. I just finished weaning myself off of my Zoloft antidepressant two weeks ago when I began taking the fish oil. I am also using light therapy equivalent to 10,000 LUX most days, so the increase in energy could also be the result of this or the combination of light therapy and fish oil. It is too soon to say all the benefits of the fish oil, however, this brand was one of the most affordable I could find online of its quality. I have noticed a few fish burps when I take it in the morning, so I started taking the fish oil at night and that solved this. I will have to update my post after taking it for a few months.

I should add that I've taken other Omega 3s in the past and didn't notice any effect, good or bad, so I think the potency and quality of this particular brand is the key.

MegaRed Krill Oil is certainly easier to take than those big fish oil pills that I was supposed to be taking.  But, to me, this was just another fishy pill to buy and to deal with each day.  Sardines turned out to be the best option for me.  The whole sardines are the best quality but I really don't like looking at those little dead minnows in the can but boneless and skinless helps that problem a little by making them look less like little dead minnows.  It took some time to acquire a taste for sardines and for a while, I just had to woof them down and try not to taste them so much.  But, after a while, I got used to sardines.  I actually like sardines, now, especially the boneless skinless ones.  So, it has worked out better for me to just eat a can of sardines in olive oil almost every day and then I get some good protein and other nutrients along with plenty of fatty acids and I have less pills to buy and deal with each day.  I have to buy food and eat something, anyway; sardines have become a better value and option for me than krill oil or fish oil pills."}, {"title": "Getting rid of all the fat I had builtup over many years.

Recently I began carefully researching omega 3 brands for mood elevation and was surprised how \"nothing special\" these omegas are.  For starters, it's not on the IFOS chart of omegas, which I would want for my brand (and for the money they cost). And although these are advertised as \"1000 mg,\" that's only at 2 capsules.  Even at 1000 mg, the EPA and DHA levels are lower than what you get from a single capsule of some other brands such as omegavia, nutrigold, omapure, or nordic naturals.  For the money, I'm going to Nutrigold.  Some people may be concerned that Nutrigold and omapure derive their oils from non oily fish (such as cod and white fish), but based on other reviewers 'reports and independent reading, the source of fish oils is less important than the omega 3 levels.

After that, I decided it would be smart to actually read the label!  Now I take 1 before (or with) my 2 largest meals of the day.  Problem solved.  I have no longer had a stomach ache, nor unpleasant fishy burps.  I can't tell if they make me feel any better or different, but I'm hoping my unborn baby is benefitting from them.

I won't eat it, can't stand the smell of it cooking, and often walk out of seafood restaurants if the smell is too great. So for me, having that enertic coating is a must.

I give him two pills a day (sometimes one, but usually two) so this bottle lasts almost a year. I'm very happy with this product. I have ordered Kirkland vitamins before. This is something to consider if your dog has skin issues. I also changed his food to a better quality product that has meat as a first ingredient and doesn't contain corn, wheat or soy.

Since mine love these, I can even give them as treats.  Certainly more affordable than pump bottle fish oil canine solutions.

DO NOT, however, buy the Nordic Naturals Gummy Worms version, as they taste like licking the floor of a fish hatchery.  I'm completely baffled that the company would even remotely think a child was going to consume them.  They are supposedly berry flavored vs the tangerine flavor these have.  The worms are not even close to being edible, even for adults."}, {"title": "Expensive but worth it!", "helpful": 0, "rating": "5", "body": "Great taste, my kid asks for these each morning!

My kids are age 7 and 4.  They ask for these \"fishies\" after dinner.  I would recommend you eat them with a meal and follow it with teeth brushing.  My kids like them because they are pretty sugary.  The combination of sticky and sugary are a combination for cavities, so teeth brushing is a must.  Also, these fish are huge.  I would say they are the size of 3 goldfish crackers lined up.  I haven't noticed any allergic responses, stomach problems, or smell.

She said the worms tasted too much like \"medicine\" and were \"yucky.\"  She has one of these fish everyday and eats the whole thing which is really good for her.
