I've also noticed that on the days I use it (pre-workout around 6AM) I end up feeling very tired for the rest of the day. And I mean really tired and unproductive. So I looked up the side effects of BCAA today and here's a snippet about the side effects (pay attention to \"known to occur\") from WebMD: \"Some side effects are known to occur, such as fatigue and loss of coordination. Branched-chain amino acids should be used cautiously before or during activities where performance depends on motor coordination, such as driving.\" And it looks like this goes to all BCAA supplementation, not just this one. On the positive side, this means that this product is real BCAA! But on the negative side, it looks like supplementing with BCAA is not that good. A safer choice would be relying on the naturally occurring BCAA in protein shakes."}, {"rating": "2", "helpful": 1, "title": "I can't take it but kudos to those who can", "body": "I tried to soldier up but I couldn't handle it.

For weight room or athletic performance gains experts say you should take at the very least 5 grams PER pre/during/post workout to be effective and feel/see a difference. Look it up, do some research; My mistake that I didn't before I bought these. I say that because in 3 pills you get roughly 2 grams of BCAA (1050mg Leucine, 450mg Isoleucine, 450mg Valine). To get the recommended dosage by most professionals, you need to take 9 pills to get enough BCAA, or 3x what SHEER is recommending on the bottle. Pills are convenient and why I bought them, but this is likely why most BCAAs are in powder form, you just need more than what is feasible to be taking in pill form. When you break it down in relation of cost to qty of BCAAs, you are also ahead of the game getting the powder.

On flavor, you must understand that BCAAs are inherently bitter. You cannot fault ON for providing the product as described. Honestly, taking it straight isn't that bad, however, I understand that some people are highly sensitive to bitterness. If flavor is still a problem, my recommendation to treat it like bad tequila. Countering the bad taste of hard alcohol works just as well for unflavored BCAAs. Mix less than 8 ounces of water with the powder. The less volume the better, so you'll be able to gulp it down in one go. Take a small amount of salt on your tongue, gulp down the liquid, and chase with some straight lime or lemon juice. Salty is a well known counter to bitter. Prepping the tongue with pure salt helps soften the bitter shock. After gulping the BCAAs, the bitterness is well again countered with an alternative strong taste, sour. Using lemon or lime has the additional benefit of ending on a refreshing citrus note. This combination completely clears any of the rubbery bitter aftertaste.

This week alone, I've worked out during lunch for about 45 minutes, combining weights, and intervals on the treadmill.  In one week, taking these supplements before my workouts and maintaining the low carb diet, I've lost 5lbs.  This is a big deal for me, because as I get older, the slower the weight comes off, so 5lbs in a week is better than great!  I have about 30lbs I'd like to lose, and I'm feeling pretty optimistic.  I don't think it's a placebo effect, I think the supplements actually work.  Let's just hope it doesn't wear off.  I'll follow-up in a few weeks."}, {"rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "title": "A wonderful product worth the money", "body": "A wonderful product worth the money!!

I experienced none of the \"jangled nerves\" that often accompanies energy supplements, but rather a calm determined-to-finish endurance.  I searched the web for bad side effects, and found no real caution.  However, I use the supplement sparingly, including it only on days when I need to go the distance.  It's not really expensive, and I am glad I gave it a try.  I encourage you to give it a fair try, remembering that my results were more subtle at first than most products.

I hopped into the shower and began to scrub myself, hoping that the friction and heated water would ease the itchy, burning sensation, and it did help a tiny bit. But as soon as I got out the shower, the burning, itching sensation was back full force. All I could do was lay on my bed in a towel, thinking about how I wanted to skin myself alive and run through a sprinkler of peroxide and how that would feel much better than this. The horrible feeling lasted for a good 30 minutes. Since then, I take only half of one scoop in 20oz of water. (Hey, I bought it, right? May as well use it up, but slowly.) A faint burning/ \"tingling\" sensation is still present, but it's not too bad as long as I occupy myself and try not to think about it. And as far as recovery? Well, I'm still sore the next day, but I guess I'm okay seeing as how I have never, and will never, take the full recommended dosage. Maybe I'm just sensitive to the amino acids, but what I felt did not equate to a tingle at all."}, {"rating": "5", "helpful": 0, "title": "Great work out prep!", "body": "This stuff is great as a prep or pre-work out!
