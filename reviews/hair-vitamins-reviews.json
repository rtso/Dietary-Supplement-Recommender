I always used to have little pimples on my forehead and then some on my neck and near my temples.. but it just depended on the week..some weeks were way better than others for my skin... people who get regular acne will understand what I mean. After being on accutane.. my skin become gorgeous..both times it lasted for about a year and then I would begin to have break outs again. I would go tanning in tanning beds just to try to dry out the pimples or it would just make my face darker which I felt hid my acne..(it actually just was damaging my skin even more and causing me more oily breakouts)..as much as I knew tanning was awful for me.. it was the one thing that I felt helped( although it really didn't!) I started taking sugar bear hair two months ago.. I can't say my skin was awful before taking them because it wasn't.. it wasnt great either.. but ever since I began taking these delicious gummies.. I swear I rarely get a pimple!!! My forehead I so smooth and clear along with the rest of my face. Bottom line.. these things are delicious.. I would eat a handful if I could. I figured they were just a fluke ad that everyone posts on instagram.. but I'm telling you.. it really works. I have longer hair to start but I have noticed stronger and thinker hair.

The Vitamins have a very good taste, to me the they taste like a gummy from an Avenger or Nemo gummy Box, not that sweet but just enough to have a very good flavor as well they don't get stuck and embedded into your teeth and gums. They do not leave your teeth with a blue tint nor your tongue. When I started taking this product I noticed into my second week my hair was more bouncy instead of flat and thin laying. I noticed a shimmer in my hair I hadn't noticed in a very long time ( a natural shimmer shine, not one you pay for) and I truly took more notice on how my hair growth was coming along and it was definitely improving on my growth, rapidly. My texture in my hair feels smooth and not frizzy nor baby hair texture (fuzzy) like it was before and yes it was that quick ( just in 2 weeks) and no I'm not over exaggerating lol. A lot less hair falling out in the shower and in my brush.

I always used to have little pimples on my forehead and then some on my neck and near my temples.. but it just depended on the week..some weeks were way better than others for my skin... people who get regular acne will understand what I mean. After being on accutane.. my skin become gorgeous..both times it lasted for about a year and then I would begin to have break outs again. I would go tanning in tanning beds just to try to dry out the pimples or it would just make my face darker which I felt hid my acne..(it actually just was damaging my skin even more and causing me more oily breakouts)..as much as I knew tanning was awful for me.. it was the one thing that I felt helped( although it really didn't!) I started taking sugar bear hair two months ago.. I can't say my skin was awful before taking them because it wasn't.. it wasnt great either.. but ever since I began taking these delicious gummies.. I swear I rarely get a pimple!!! My forehead I so smooth and clear along with the rest of my face. Bottom line.. these things are delicious.. I would eat a handful if I could. I figured they were just a fluke ad that everyone posts on instagram.. but I'm telling you.. it really works. I have longer hair to start but I have noticed stronger and thinker hair.

I don't dye my hair hair, don't put heat on it since I wear it natural, and I trim it twice a year. My hair before taking these has normal thickness, but I have a lot of fallout, and it has always been shiny and has a lot of elasticity even without product. So within this one month period I haven't seen much change with that. And my hair length has always stopped growing at my nipple, so that's the main reason why I tried these supplements, but still in the one month period haven't seen any change in that either. And for my nails, my nails have always been super long and strong so I haven't seen a difference in that. It didn't give me any breakouts taking them so that's good, and they taste delicious, even when I normally hate eating anything that has gelatin  consistency, but I would eat the whole bottle if I could.

My hair has never been more shiny, bouncy and just healthy looking overall. I love it! But the reason I give it 4 stars is because I am a hairy girl, and this doesn't just grow your head hair it grows ALL hair. So I have to see what I want to sacrifice in a way. Do I want long flowing hair with a mustache? I don't think anyone does lol. I will re-purchase again but ill try to do it every couple of month's because I don't want it to be a constant growth. These pills have helped fill in my eyebrows and have helped grow my baby hairs back. So yes they do grow hair but remember everyone's body is different and my experience probably wont be yours.

I'm down to two days left in my one month supply but I still don't know if they're worth buying again. My hair is naturally curly/wavy, due to the fact that in half black half filipino. I don't dye my hair hair, don't put heat on it since I wear it natural, and I trim it twice a year. My hair before taking these has normal thickness, but I have a lot of fallout, and it has always been shiny and has a lot of elasticity even without product. So within this one month period I haven't seen much change with that. And my hair length has always stopped growing at my nipple, so that's the main reason why I tried these supplements, but still in the one month period haven't seen any change in that either. And for my nails, my nails have always been super long and strong so I haven't seen a difference in that. It didn't give me any breakouts taking them so that's good, and they taste delicious, even when I normally hate eating anything that has gelatin  consistency, but I would eat the whole bottle if I could.

Of course, it doesn't look like virgin hair or anything, but I see a big improvement from just taking this supplement for three weeks.

My hair is much stronger and shinier and I noticed this after taking for 2 weeks. It takes longer to notice the hair growth but you will after 2 months of taking.

I tried another very popular vitamin a couple years ago, which worked REALLY well, however, it caused me to have severe cystic acne, & I had had clear skin for pretty much all of my life (I know it was something in the formulation, because my mom also broke out from them). So, I had to stop them. Subsequent to that, I had just been dealing with hair breakage, no matter what I used on my hair or did to modify my diet. After doing a lot of research here on Amazon, and being skeptical of many of the different types of vitamins, because one, I did not want severe acne again, and two, a lot of these reviews are from people who receive free or extremely discounted products, l finally decided on this one because of its ingredients (and no soy). I can say after taking these vitamins for one month, I have noticed a difference in my hair. It is not a miracle, hence the four star rating, and my hair grows pretty slow. However, I did notice within the first two to three weeks of taking the vitamins that my hair texture was a lot softer (I think someone else mentioned that too in another review), and my nails appeared to get stronger by about 20%. Also my hair has not really grown faster, but it stopped shedding, so that is a major benefit. Plus, I have not experienced the side effects of any skin breakouts yet. I plan to take these vitamins for another two months, since they say that generally speaking, you must wait for 90 days to see real results for any hair vitamins. Fingers crossed. So far so good though....definitely worth a try. And, this is coming from someone who paid the full $25 for the vitamins (sigh...thank goodness they were down to $19.99 when I reordered!)"}, {"rating": "5", "helpful": 2, "title": "I really love this product", "body": "My hair is growing fast and my skin is glowing.

I tried another very popular vitamin a couple years ago, which worked REALLY well, however, it caused me to have severe cystic acne, & I had had clear skin for pretty much all of my life (I know it was something in the formulation, because my mom also broke out from them). So, I had to stop them. Subsequent to that, I had just been dealing with hair breakage, no matter what I used on my hair or did to modify my diet. After doing a lot of research here on Amazon, and being skeptical of many of the different types of vitamins, because one, I did not want severe acne again, and two, a lot of these reviews are from people who receive free or extremely discounted products, l finally decided on this one because of its ingredients (and no soy). I can say after taking these vitamins for one month, I have noticed a difference in my hair. It is not a miracle, hence the four star rating, and my hair grows pretty slow. However, I did notice within the first two to three weeks of taking the vitamins that my hair texture was a lot softer (I think someone else mentioned that too in another review), and my nails appeared to get stronger by about 20%. Also my hair has not really grown faster, but it stopped shedding, so that is a major benefit. Plus, I have not experienced the side effects of any skin breakouts yet. I plan to take these vitamins for another two months, since they say that generally speaking, you must wait for 90 days to see real results for any hair vitamins. Fingers crossed. So far so good though....definitely worth a try. And, this is coming from someone who paid the full $25 for the vitamins (sigh...thank goodness they were down to $19.99 when I reordered!)"}, {"rating": "2", "helpful": 1, "title": "All hair vitamins are not for everyone :(", "body": "Very little growth.

I visited my doctor and he said more than likely it was due to stress ( I was laid off and haven't been able to find a job).  Well the hair loss continued and the doc recommended Rogaine.  I wasn't quite ready to go there yet and wanted to know if there were other options.  I tried taking 10,000 milligrams of biotin (a popular brand sold at Costco) and did so for about 2 months.  My hair was still falling out at the same rate. I contacted my doctor and asked for a referral to a dermatologist.  The dermatologist checked my scalp and said yes there is thinning but your scalp is healthy. He told me, in a nice way, to lose some wait and adopt a better diet.  Well okay then.  So when all else fails I come to Amazon to check out what's available for hair loss and that's when I found a miracle.  I ordered the Hair Growth Vitamins and they were delivered on 12/17.
