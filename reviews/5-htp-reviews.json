I usually trust them but I find NaturalWise 5htp much much better. The first most important aspect I have notions that it doesn't upset my stomach even when I take it on an empty stomach. Second it does help take the edge of my feelings of stressed out and third I fast regularly and like most fasters will know, fasting cleans all the senses. Including the sense of taste so when a fast is broken the first bite of any food is taken it will taste like the best ever in the whole wide world...,and so I find myself eat like it's the last meal ever!!!! Which makes it hard to not overeat. So this 5 htp taken before or even during my first meal after fasting really really helps takes the edge of my taste sense so as food doesn't taste really good and I feel full much more faster. But when I am not fasting my hunger is pretty normal taking thi 5htp. I definitely do recommend it but also really recommend reading up and researching on the supplement. There are aspects of 5htp that need to be known for instance if taken at night your body converts it into melatonin and induces to sleep ( because lack of sun light) and if you don't need it cause you produce enough of it naturally you might feel pretty sad and like crying crazy for no reason.

I knew this was not how I wanted to be but could not stop feeling this way, I knew living like this was affecting my life and the ones I loved . I have been on antidepressants before and have stopped because of some side effect that would manifest sooner or later .  I hated the idea of being on them - never had any real relief anyways .

The best advice I can give is get on the internet and do your own research on symptoms of low serotonin levels . Read other people's experience using 5 htp , start with the lowest dosage and go from there . I figured out that for me it was best to take it late in the evening , right after supper or even a couple hours after supper was o.k.

I thought perhaps it was because I worked out too hard the day before or I was on one of my moody PMDD trips but this felt different.

I knew this was not how I wanted to be but could not stop feeling this way, I knew living like this was affecting my life and the ones I loved . I have been on antidepressants before and have stopped because of some side effect that would manifest sooner or later .  I hated the idea of being on them - never had any real relief anyways . I also would look up self help articles on the web , books , anything I thought would help with this problem I've been living with for most of my life . Then I came across information on the internet about 5 htp , decided to give it a shot - it's one of the best things I've ever done for myself , and I hope others suffering in the same way find the same relief I have had with this product . The best advice I can give is get on the internet and do your own research on symptoms of low serotonin levels . Read other people's experience using 5 htp , start with the lowest dosage and go from there . I figured out that for me it was best to take it late in the evening , right after supper or even a couple hours after supper was o.k. Mornings was not a good time because I felt it kind of made me feel edgy . The good results really started kicking in about three weeks taking this product , I am amazed at the peace of mind I have now , it's so good to go about my day and not have some horrible negative thought take over my mind completely.

The supplement market is full of products that offer no real benefit to the consumer other than lining the pockets of the manufacturer.

After reading about the benefits of 5-HTP (antidepressant, appetite suppressant, great sleep aid.) I decided to try it. It works to great effect which is also the reason I would recommend caution. When they say to be careful if you have an issue with depression or take antidepressants or have bipolar disorder, heed the advice. 5-HTP can seriously jack up your serotonin levels and throw you into mania or acute depression. Take exactly as it says on the bottle. If you take the recommended dose and take it at night, it is a great way to help you sleep and works better than any antidepressant I have ever taken. If you have a tendency (as I do) to think that if one is good, then four must be better, then be prepared to ride an emotional roller coaster that will last for as long as it takes for your serotonin levels to return to a semblance of normal. I mean it, this stuff is powerful.

However, when I switched to the 200mg, I experienced only 1-2 days of notable 'mood change', possibly related to accomodating to the higher dose? Or it could have been coincidental, related to other factors on those given days - hard to say. After that, pretty much back to what I was feeling on 100mg. Not a bad thing, still sleeping better & with the 'other' benefit as mentioned, so that's good. But as far as dramatic change or uptick in mood? Nothing notable for me.

I can only tell you my personal impressions.  I understand that they help in 3 main areas:  better sleep, less appetite and better mood. After a few days of taking them, I actually did start sleeping better.  I typically wake up a lot at night, but lately it's been reduced to almost never. When I do wake up, I'm able to go right back to sleep. I've felt more rested overall. So two thumbs up in that department. Regarding the benefit to your appetite, I've seen positive change here too.  I usually have two settings: full and starving. Full lasts until about 30 minutes after I eat, and then it's right back to starving. Although I still do get hungry as normal, the edge is gone. It's much more manageable and the need to eat feels much less urgent. I don't recall having that \"starving\" sensation at any point since I began taking these supplements.  And when I do eat, I've found I'm typically consuming only about 75-80% of what I usually do.  So I never feel as hungry as I did before and my portions are smaller. So that's a total win.  As for elevating your mood, I can\u2019t speak as much to this. I\u2019m typically pretty even keeled and upbeat- so wasn\u2019t really looking to this supplement for help in this area.

But, after suffering for many years from chronic insomnia which, caused my Leptin levels to be out of control causing me to overate and gain s lot of weight. That made my existing health problems much worse. I have Lupus, severe Spinal Disc Degeneration , and spinal stenosis causing a lot of nerve damage.  That means I am in constant pain.  Prescription sleep medications and antidepressants did not help my insomnia.  Needless to say, all the above contributed to a low serotonin level and depression.  I have refused to take more prescription medications.  I am already on  too many as is. I started taking the 5-HTP twice a day as soon as I received it. I did not notice a difference until I have been taking it about 1 week. I began to sleep better, feel less hungry , and my general overall mood has improved. Getting more sleep also helped to decrease my pain level. I have felt better physically and emotionally better the past week or so then I have felt for the past 3 years.

I am a terrible sleeper. I don't have too hard a time falling asleep, but staying asleep is my problem. I've taken many things to try and get a restful night's sleep and nothing ever really helps. Melatonin rarely works, and same goes for Excedrin PM (or equivalent). Nyquil is probably the best at helping me sleep, but that's not exactly a habit I want to develop. Besides not working, all of the aforementioned  drugs always leave me groggy and tired for a large chunk of the day (including the melatonin). This stuff, on the other hand, is awesome!!! I take two pills at night before bed and I pretty much sleep all night! Granted I still toss and turn so I wake up a little from that. But I don't wake-up wake up like I normally would. I actually feel rested in the morning. Especially on my weekends when I can sleep in as long as I want. And the best thing is that it doesn't leave me feeling groggy or sluggish! If I take it on a work night (which is usually only 6-7 hours of sleep) I am tired in the morning. But not the \"Nyquil hangover\" kind of tired that I never snap out of no matter how much coffee I drink. It's more the kind of tired I imagine normal sleepers feel when they simply didn't get enough hours of sleep, but nothing a cup or two of coffee can't cure. Better sleep means a lot. That's the body's time to rest and heal itself. Better sleep means my skin complexion and acne are a little better. Better sleep means it's a little easier to make it through my 12-13 hour work days. Better sleep means I'm less cranky and don't have to drink as much coffee. While I can't attest to whether it really improves my mood due to this supplement or simply because I'm sleeping better, I would not rely on this product purely as a mood enhancer/anxiety reducer.
