The exact name of this disorder is called Acrodermatitis Enteropathica and it's a genetic autoimmune disorder that affects very few people and requires very specific genetics to line up. I spent my whole life taking other forms of Zinc pills which only caused major nausea and stomach discomfort as Zinc is very heavy and hard on the stomach, especially taken on an empty stomach. I was searching for a Zinc supplement that was designed to ease my nausea after 20 minutes when it kicks in. This product has never caused nausea and as a result I can take my full daily dose instead of dreading having to take it in fear that I haven't eaten a significant enough amount of food so to avoid nausea (in which case the Zinc and the food just comes back up on you). It's a very very awful disorder and there's nothing that can be done besides taking 1mg per weight of Zinc a day (meaning if you're 150 pounds, you need to take 150mgs of Zinc per day) that's if you have this disorder which is just slightly different than Zinc disorder but it's easier to say and explain Zinc deficiency (which can be inherited in adulthood if you're an alcoholic as alcohol eats up Zinc in the body). As long as I take this Zinc, I'm okay and living normally. But if I miss a entire week of Zinc - the symptoms begin to appear and as long as I take it again, it goes into remission. The symptoms include dermatitis, scaly patches of itchy rash on extremities (Enteropathica means extremities like legs, feet, arms, head, scalp, etc) and some other symptoms include mouth soars. It's very painful when it's been out of the system too long like weeks of not taking. I realize this is a review of this product and so I am also sharing this disorder as well for those who may need to know more about it as the disorder is rare and I hope this info finds someone who's been running from doctor to doctor to get help for their child (it begins to show itself a few weeks after the child is born or weaned off mothers milk as breast milk has Zinc and symptoms won't show up on the person until breast milk is weaned).

The taste is similar to other zinc products i have used as supplements and the price seems very fair. The only small annoyance I have found is that a chunky white residue quickly builds up on the outside of the container after pouring. While this is true of other zinc products I have never seen it happen to this magnitude before. Perhaps it is because this product is more zinc per ml which I suppose means more bang for your buck. While it's not a deal-breaker at all it is rather gross looking to have this large white growth looking thing hanging off the bottle, but again, as far as actually using the product everything seems great and this bottle will last me a long time. If you don't mind rubbing the bottle down with a clean rag every few days you should not have a problem with the outer build-up.

It's called Acrodermetitis Enteropathica. Basically it means I will begin to see Dermatitis like lesions and rough dry skin bumps / rashes on my extremities over time of missing my Zinc supplements. This is a rare disorder, so imagine how absolutely happy I was to find a product that I have to take to live that didn't make my stomach nauseous. Unlike some Zinc supplement users, I actually will die a slow and uncomfortably painful death by missing on Zinc supplementation for say more than a few months - 6+ months of 0 Zinc is imminently fatal for someone with this disorder. I spent my entire life looking for different Zinc supplements that wouldn't cause nausea. I use to have to eat a lot of heavy food to be able to keep down a Zinc pill until I found this life changing produce. See, if I don't take my Zinc, I break out into Dermatitis rashes. It does downhill from there. Yes, I've once left for a trip and thought I packed my Zinc only to find I would go 4 days without. I started to have little signs that a break out was coming. I went back on track in taking my supplement and I'm back to normal after getting my levels back up. I spent months in the hospital as a baby on the verge of death until doctors finally found the problem. I spent my childhood being fed Zinc through crushed up Zinc pills by my parents because upon them trying to give me a oral Zinc pill I would run off saying it makes my tummy hurt. I struggled until I found this supplement which I consider a life changing supplement because I now can take it on an empty stomach and not worry. And because my body doesn't retain Zinc in any other forms but supplementation, I have to take the same amount of Zinc as my body weight a day. So this product changed my life and made it easier, safer, better for me to keep Zinc levels up. This works because someone like me who doesn't produce or keep Zinc levels in her body has to take it and sees a difference. I don't know what I'd do without it but have to go back to other varieties of Zinc supplements, which would lower the quality of my life and cause me great nausea. If the Zinc comes back up on me it's like not even taking it. And the cost being a little higher is simply because it's all quality products harvested seasonally and kept up to the best standards. If you don't have to take this to save your life you don't have the same sense of appreciation for it. Enjoy eating Zinc enriched foods that your body actually absorbs into itself because I was born with DNA that lacks that ability and now have to spend the rest of my life until death supplementing with Zinc.

I have been fighting hormonal cystic acne from 28-32 (presently) and with a combination of the wonder cleanser \"Hibiclens\" and extremely light moisturizers, things are showing improvement. I am only JUST realizing I have rosacea for the first time because I have finally been given the chance to step back and realize much of the redness is also from my own skin's natural inflammation. Zinc has been tested and (apparently) proven to work really well in fighting the bacteria that causes this specific inflammation, so hopefully this will be one more step into what I hope is recovery! Normally I don't take too many supplements, but I also have PCOS, so I have heard many names pop up here and there.

I have used a number of prescription creams and pills. I've even tried that little zapit machine which did nothing for my severe acne. I did find success with a prescription antibiotic however i stopped taking it after 2 years because I didn't want to be come immune to it. I came across this product and saw the reviews - I figured for $8 bucks it was worth a shot. I ordered on December 8, 2011 and am writing this  review on January 12, 2012. I am happy to report that my acne outbreaks (which occur weekly like clockwork!) have greatly subsided! I noticed that my pimples/nodules were less and less frequent within a couple weeks of taking this, yet they still appeared. So I wasn't quite ready to claim success just yet. But now after a month, I've completed my first bump-free week and I feel like I'm ready to go run around naked in the snow! Now to be fair: I do wash my face with an organic tea-tree oil face wash, and I do use tea-tree oil on my face - but I've done that for months prior to the pills and continue to use them to this day (it definitely works to clean the skin)... So needless to say I'm very pleased with this product. For the customer who complained about having to take pills daily - that's just going to be a part of life dude. I'd rather be taking a zinc supplement like this (which zinc is also recommended to treat a cold and boost your immune system)then take an expensive prescription whose list of side-effects contains \"THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE\" (WTF?!).. You may also need to change some of your habits/behaviors if you're going to truly take your skin-care seriously. Watch out for coffee - cleanse your face at least 2x per day - use sun-screen - use moisturizer (preferably oil-free) - don't touch your face (period! i struggle with this one) - watch your food intake.. the more grease/oil you put in, the more that could potentially come out your face - reduce stress - and don't worry about the acne - look in the mirror and tell yourself \"I AM PHOTOGENIC\" daily (and believe it) you'll feel much better off...."}, {"rating": "5", "helpful": 8, "title": "Good 'N Natural is GREAT!", "body": "My son has only been using them for a week, but I see some improvements with his acne.

Before the pills, I was getting at least two or three new pimples a week.  Small as well as the deep, red painful ones. I am so relieved to come across these pills!

I tried everything , but nothing was working topically.  I tried acnefree severe, proactive , noxema , garnier, etc. .... So then I decided to try internal remedies  like drinking green tea , drinking lots of water , eating fruits and vegetables more than the usual , cutting back and not eating dairy , or greasy foods.  I started reading on foods that help rid acne and while reading a couple of blogs and web sites I came across foods that contain zinc , like parsley , spinach , salmon and others on the internet , so I researched on zinc, turns out I'm deficient in this.  I had all the side effects of zinc deficiency. I was tired, was losing my hair, brittle nails, acne, poor wound healing, dandruff etc.  Zinc helps prevent inflammatory wounds , fights bacteria ,fights dandruff , helps out eye function. It helps with vitamin A absorption. It helps with hair loss.  With skin. Colds viruses. There is so much it helps with.  My skin hasn't been as oily as it was before. All my old acne is disappearing , and my skin is smoother.  I have had more confidence lately .  I take this with a GNC multivitamin for woman in my case.  I only take one since my multivitamin has zinc in it as well. I read that you're not supposed to take to much zinc because it can become toxic to the body , it can deplete other nutrients . 30 mg is effective enough.  If you have cystic acne and oily skin, try it!  It wouldn't hurt!

I have started to having painful acne- big cystic ones that went absolutely crazy during my menstrual cycle-.in my early 30s- I am 38 now. It has caused scarring on my face and actually began to affect me emotionally. I had not even had any issues during puberty and it has sucked to have them as an adult. However, after trying everything possible, I gave up and decided to just accept and love myself with acne or not. One day, reading an article on zinc deficiency, I decided to search products in Amazon and this was the highest rated zinc product. So I ordered it, not really believing that it would work...Oh my God, I am still in shocked that it actually has been working so miraculously!!!! Before I have finished the 1st bottle my face was half way cleared and now, I am half way through my second bottle and my face is almost completely clear. Even my 4 year old nephew noticed it!!!! I do not get big, red cystic ones anymore and I barely get any acne on my face! and my face is healing beautifully!  The only downside of this product is that it could be a little harsh on the tummy, if you have a sensitive stomach like mine.
