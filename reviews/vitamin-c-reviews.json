I take 1 gram (1,000 mg.) three times a day with meals.  My adrenal glands are healing nicely with this.  Of course I take this ascorbic acid along with other supplements I purchased on Amazon (pantothenic acid, magnesium,  rhodiola, ashwaghanda, licorice, Tulsi, burdock, etc) as part of a comprehensive adrenal fatigue healing program.  The adrenal glands use a large amount of the body's vitamin C, especially during times of stress.  It is wise to give your body extra C as humans cannot manufacture it in our body, unlike most animals.  Also,  adrenal glands are integral to a healthy, functioning immune system.  Ascorbic acid is water soluble and excess will be excreted by the body.  To be absorbed optimally and not cause GI distress, it is best taken with meals, preferably in divided doses."}, {"title": "Pure Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Powder 500g", "helpful": 7, "rating": "5", "body": "I've wanted to try a vitamin C facial serum for a long time, but the ones I've found were so expensive.

I will add that this powder dissolves completely in enough water and is pure L-Ascorbic acid. What more do you need? I don't care if it is from China or made from GMO corn as the end result is a pure L-Ascorbic molecule that wouldn't be any different if it were extracted directly from an Orange. The molecule is the molecule. I came across a great tip-try dissolving a small amount, half teaspon maybe in a saline solution and putting that in a nosespray bottle.

Google DIY face serum and this is a must have ingredient. BulkSupplements Pure Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is HIGH quality powder with a very reasonable price-tag, that comes in a mylar resealable pouch, and is now a staple for my facial regimen. Try this recipe I found on fairviewfarmlife(dotcom) 1/2 tsp Ascorbic Acid; 5 tsp. rose or distilled water {this is important as the high oxygen content in tap water will cause the Vit. C to break down faster.}; 3 tsp. almond oil; 1/2 tsp. olive/jojoba/coconut {basically any carrier oil}; 3 drops geranium essential oil; 3 drops lavender essential oil; {I add 1/2 tsp. of Hyaluronic acid which I also buy from BulkSupplements, and when using distilled water, I sometimes sub rosehip oil in place of the geranium}. First mix the Vit. C crystals with the rose OR distilled water. Stir frequently until completely dissolved. This may take up to 20 minutes, but you want to make sure you don't have a grainy mixture. Also, do not heat the distilled water. Heat will cause the Vit. C to break down and you want the maximum effectiveness on your skin. Add the rest of the ingredients and then stir until mixed well. Then carefully funnel into a 2 oz. small dark dropper bottle {You need a dark bottle as the light can cause the ascorbic acid to lose potency}, and shake shake shake your way to younger, more beautiful skin. I phrase it that way because you really need to shake it up! It may take a couple of days to completely rid the serum of the gritty feel, but after that you'll get a magical solution to dry, aging skin and the proof will be in the mirror as well as the compliments you will be showered with. Please note, if you follow this recipe, do NOT double as it will only keep for up to two weeks. After that, the serum loses potency. Ascorbic acid breaks down fast and you want it to be super fresh for maximum absorption. Shake it up before each use, and apply at night after cleansing and follow up with a moisturizer. VOILA!

It seems to work immediately, no upset stomach, no heartburn,  no fillers.  Just an excellent citrus taste that is good for me and also freshens my breath.  I guess if you dislike the taste you could mix it with some orange or perhaps lemonade type juice.  I couldn't be happier, this pure Vitamin C powder is the only way I will use viamin C from now on.  It costs so much less than the pills i usually buy. I'm sure many people may have gotten one if those huge pills \"caught\" in their throat?  Not a pleasant experience.  Whatever the pill makers use as a filler has an awful, bitter taste that seems to linger.  Not this powder,  It could linger all day on my tongue  and I would be happy.  I sometimes use just a very tiny pinch of it on my tongue as a breath mint. Strange I'm sure.  But I really, really like it.  Since vitamin C is water soluble I don't think you could take too much?  I wonder if anybody out there in \"Amazon Land\" could answer to this?  I don't want to overuse a good thing.

Vitamin C is a miracle from God for countless health related issues,  and our family has benefitted greatly from it.

First, you take a quart size jar and add it 10 tbs of sunflower lecithin powder, then add to that 4 tbs of the Vitamin C powder.  Add about 3 cups distilled water, cap, and gently shake.  Let the jar sit in the frig overnight and shake vigorously in the am. viola, it liposomes itself.  You can still plop it in the ultrasonic for 10-15 minutes if you wish, but its great if your in a pinch and don't have time.  We have tried it both ways and can barely taste a difference.  Plus, only need about 1 oz instead of 2oz, which is nice and can make it last a bit longer in between batches.

In the short time that I have started my own liposomal vitamin C I have seen significant improvement in my stamina, blood flow and overall energy. I found Bulk Supplements Pure Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) being sold in larger amounts than sold in big box department stores and even the health food stores where I live.

I was also impressed with the options of purchasing from 3.5 ounces at a time or all the way up to 55 pounds of it if I chose to. That's right...55 pounds. I recently found out that most low cost glucose meters cannot distinguish between glucose (sugar) and vitamin C in the blood stream (because vitamin c is derived from glucose), so when I take a dose of vitamin C in any form I can determine if my body is getting it into the blood stream and to what efficiency by using a glucose meter every ten minutes after taking a dose of vitamin C. I use my glucose meter before taking the vitamin C to get a baseline reading, take a 5 gm dose of homemade liposomal vitamin C or occasionally dissolve 5 gms in some water, check my glucose ten minutes after taking that dose, check my glucose ten minutes after that (20 mins) and then ten minutes after that (30 mins). I usually do not take more than three glucose readings after taking a dose of Bulk Supplements' vitamin C.

Dr. Saul also says that Ascorbic Acid is one vitamin that the body doesn't differentiate when it comes to the synthetic vs. natural form.  I also try to eat Vitamin C rich foods regularly.

As a 40 years sufferer of BV (during which time, Drs. misdiagnosed it 99% of the time), I was willing to try anything.  And voila...first time in 40 years, I am symptom free, after ONE day.  It's the cheapest miracle on earth.  BTW, others who use it for the same reason, insert 500 mg nightly for a few nights, but that dosage caused pretty significant burning (both inside and out, and caused a rash on my inner thighs), so I cut the dosage to 1/2 pill weekly, and it works perfectly.  So, adjust your dose as you like.  And if you find it starts to burn, just take a bath and the burning stops immediately.  Chose this brand because it is contains no artificial color, flavor, sweetener, sugar, starch, lactose, milk, soy, gluten, wheat, yeast, fish or sodium.

That being said, the body, if given too much vitamin C, will have a reaction in the form of mild to medium diarrhea. If that does happen then drop dose by 1/4 and that is your bodies safe max level. You would have to be in the 15,000 to 40,000 mg range before that would happen. Fact: Vitamin C, in the presence of cancer cells, becomes an Oxydator that Will kill those cells. There are 3 primary things that effect the body. 1) Fungi, 2)Virus' 3)Bacterial. Vitamin C, in the presence of these issues becomes an Oxydator and keeps them at bay. Vitamin C is water soliable and must be taken throughout the day. Use the Vitamin C with Rose Hip, it helps to retain more of the C during release. I take 10,000 mg daily and I don't keep a cold, when they do come on, more than a few hours.  Read up on Dr. Linus Pauling, 2 time Nobel Peace Prize Recipient. He, Dr. Abram Hoffer and Dr. Max Gerson, (Read about Dr. Max Gerson and his Life Saving, Proven Cure against cancer with Case Studies), have proven the Absolute healing effects of this Vitamin, as well as many ohers. You can read all about this information at orthomolecular.org They even have list of doctors worldwide who are Ortho Molecular specialist that truely treat your whole body with, near, no pharmaseuticals. The Corporate pharmacy monsters do not care about your health. Do yourself a favor and start Really Studying on subjects like Ortho Molecular medicine, Hollistic Medicines, Homiopathic medicine, The Endocrine System (especially the Thyroid Gland. I chose Dr. David Brownstein, leading expert in his book: Overcoming Thyroid Disorders. Near 80% of All Americans are walking around with an abnormal thyroid gland. Doctors today are being trained to ignore our sympthoms and reley on lab results.They are loosing their ability to know the symptoms). Get back to the basics of life and escape this crazy illusion of Corporate Dictatorship. Ask yourself this. Why are boys growing breast and some being born with no genitils? Why are girls becoming physically more masculine? Why is Cancer up 5,000% since the 50's in most cases and 20,000% in a few special cases? We have all these walks for the Cure, but never do we ask \"hey, why is Cancer up all over the place?\" Fight Cancer by fighting ignorance. The AMA (American Medical Association) doesn't care about your health. They are, and have been for some time now, a Eugenics Political system. Please do yourself a favor and Look up The Beginings of Euginics and the people who have pushed this Antihumanistic view on the poor and ill. Look, get healthy by getting informed and being responsible for Yourself. No Sheeple in 2014!!!

Not only will high quantities of Vitamin C help the body fight colds and other illnesses, but it improves allergies.

Our bodies cannot manufacture Vitamin C.  We must get it from food or supplements.  From my reading about Vitamin C, we probably need much more than most people get.  The government recommendations are only based on what it takes to prevent scurvy rather than what it takes to be healthy in general.  These days the soil on most farms is so depleted that it is pretty much impossible to get the nutrition we need from food alone so supplements are a necessity for good health.  However, not all supplements are the same.  Many cheaper supplements contain synthetic vitamins our bodies cannot use.  Some Vitamin C is created from mold.  The best vitamins come from real food.

The technique doesn't allow it to be certified organic.

He had a suspicious mole removed about a month ago (family Hx of melanoma, so he's very diligent about regular check-ups). Well, this one came back positive (in situ, though, so they got it all in the initial biopsy). He complained a little about my insistence that he start taking these daily, but he does take them! I think the recommended minimum dose is 1-2 tabs daily, but I give him 3 (for now -- haha), in addition to a vitamin D3 tab. So 4 pills. If I put them out for him, he remembers to take them, so it's a small hassle for good preventive medicine. I bought the buffered to ensure that he takes them knowing he won't have stomach issues or heartburn, and I like that I can get 1000mg per tab so he doesn't have to take a bunch to get a good dose. Let me also just add a little pearl of wisdom that we both kinda learned the hard way: don't take vitamin C at night. It is a stimulant of sorts and can keep you awake! However, I will also say that since he doesn't take any other meds, he tends to be more sensitive to anything he actually does take.

I do not recommend the caplets/tablets, as I have not had as good of results with them.  I began taking Ester-C after reading articles about how it was used to help improve the lives of large breed dogs that had hip dysplasia problems.  At the time I was suffering from a lot of lower back pain, and I did not want to take typical OTC pain relievers.  I found that it takes 2-3 weeks for this product to begin to alleviate pain.  For me, it truly has reduced pain!  I have also learned from my experience, that if you discontinue the use of the Ester-C, the pain returns in about 2-3 weeks.  So, it apparently has some residual qualities.  If you take too much it will cause the runs,  so be forewarned!  While I primarily take Ester-C for back pain, it does also help with hip and other joint pains.  My primary, go to, supplement for arthritic joint pains is Boswellia Extract (I use Nature's Answer brand).  Taking the Ester-C and the Boswellia Extact in combination leaves me feeling as nimble as someone much younger than my 55 years old.

In the past I usually catch anything he gets, but not this time. This is especially significant because I take strong meds for RA that compromise/ suppress my immune system. I take this Ester C regularly. He takes it, but just once in a while. Can't prove it but it sure looks like the Ester C (along with prayers) made the difference. I usually take great care in choosing what brand of vitamin to purchase. Can't remember why I chose Solgar, but can assure you I researched my options at the time, and I chose Solgar for good reasons. Probably should do your own research to see what option is the best match for you. This product is a great choice for me. Also note that previous to taking this Ester C I took a lot of regular Vitamin C. (I still take a some) but did not observe the above positive trend until I started taking the Ester C.
