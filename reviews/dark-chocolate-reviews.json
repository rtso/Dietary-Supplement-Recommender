Note: 'cacao' (which is on the label) is the original spelling for cocoa and is, in fact, cocoa. I suspect these bars use it to seem more... refined. Anyway, these are 72% cocoa, which is very chocolatey but still sweet enough to appease most who claim to like chocolate. Higher cocoa content will begin to be too bitter/unsweet for most. If someone says they like dark chocolate, these are a good bet to get them, as these are dark enough not to seem too sweet, and yet sweet enough so as not to seem too bitter.
